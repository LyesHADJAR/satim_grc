The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities to prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCIDSS assessment. The PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures begin on page 43 .PCI DSS comprises a minimum set of requirements for protecting account data and may be enhanced by additional controls and pr actices tofurther mitigate risks, and to incorporate local, regional, and sector laws and regulations. Additionally, legislation or regulatory requirementsmay require specific protection of personal information or other data elements (for example, cardholder name).LimitationsIf any of the requirements contained in this standard conflict with country, state, or local laws, the country, state, or loc al law will apply.PCI DSS ResourcesThe PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) website ( www.pcisecuritystandards.org) provides the following additional resources to assistorganizations with their PCI DSS assessments and validations: Document Library, including:- PCI DSS Summary of Changes- PCI DSS Quick Reference Guide- Information Supplements and Guidelines- Prioritized Approach for PCI DSS- Report on Compliance (ROC) Reporting Template and Reporting Instructions- Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) and SAQ Instructions and Guidelines- Attestations of Compliance (AOCs ) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) PCI for Small Merchants website PCI training courses and informational webinars List of Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) and Approved Scanning Vendors ( ASVs ) Lists of PCI approved devices, applications , and solutionsThere are over 60 guidance documents and information supplements available on the PCI SSC website that provide specific guidance andconsiderations for PCI DSS.

Note : Information Supplementscomplement PCI DSS and identifyadditional considerations andrecommendations for meeting PCIDSS requirements. InformationSupplements do not supersede,replace, or extend PCI DSS or anyof its requirements.2 PCI DSS Applicability InformationPCI DSS is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and or sensitive authentication data (SAD) or couldimpact the security of the cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data. This includes all entities involved in payment accountprocessing -including merchants, processors, acquirers , issuers, and other service providers.Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that managecompliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers) ; contact these organizations for any additional criteria.Defining Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication DataCardholder data and sensitive authentication data are considered account data and are defined as follows:Table 2. Account DataAccount DataCardholder Data includes: Sensitive Authentication Data includes: Primary Account Number (PAN) Cardholder Name Expiration Date Service Code Full track data (magnetic -stripe data or equivalent on a chip) Card verification code PINs PIN blocksPCI DSS requirements apply to entities with environments where account data (cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data) is stored,processed, or transmitted, and entities with environments that can impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data.Some PCI DSS requirements may also apply to entities with environments that do not store, process, or transmit account data for example,entities that outsource payment operations or management of their cardholder data environment ( CDE )1. Entities that outsource their paymentenvironments or payment operations to third parties remain responsible for ensuring that the account data is protected by the third party perapplicable PCI DSS requirements.1 In accordance with those organizations that manage compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers); entities should contact the se organizationsfor more details.The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor for cardholder data. The term account data therefore covers the following: the fullPAN, any other elements of cardholder data that are present with the PAN, and any elements of sensitive authenticati on data.If cardholder name, service code, and or expiration date are stored, processed, or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in theCDE, they must be protected in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements applicable to cardholder data.If an entity stores, processes, or transmits PAN, then a CDE exists to which PCI DSS requirements will apply. Some requirements may not beapplicable, for example if the entity does not store PAN, then the requirements relating to the protection of stored PAN in Requirement 3 willnot be applicable to the entity.Even if an entity does not store, process, or transmit PAN, some PCI DSS requirements may still apply. Consider the following : If the entity stores SAD, requirements specifically related to SAD storage in Requirement 3 will be applicable. If the entity engages third- party service providers to store, process or transmit PAN on its behalf, requirements related to themanagement of service providers in Requirement 12 will be applicable. If the entity can impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data because the security of an entity'sinfrastructure can affect how cardholder data is processed (for example, via a web server that controls the generation of a payment formor page) some requirements will be applicable. If cardholder data is only present on physical media (for example paper), requirements relating to the security and disposal of physicalmedia in Requirement 9 will be applicable. Requirements related to an incident response plan are applicable to all entities, to ensure that there are procedures to foll ow in theevent of a suspected or actual breach of the confidentiality of cardholder data.Use of Account Data, Sensitive Authentication Data, Cardholder Data, and Primary Account Number in PCI DSSPCI DSS includes requirements that specifically refer to account data, cardholder data, and sensitive authentication data. It is important tonote that each of these types of data are different and the terms are not interchangeable. Specific references wit hin requirements to accountdata, cardholder data, or sensitive authentication data are purposeful, and the requirements apply specifically to the type of data that isreferenced.Elements of Account Data and Storage RequirementsTable 3 identifies the elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is permitted orprohibited, and whether each data element must be rendered unreadable-for example, with strong cryptography -when stored. This tableis not exhaustive and is presented to illustrate only how the stated requirements apply to the different data elements.Table 3. Account Data Element Storage RequirementsData Elements Storage Restrictions Required to Render Stored DataUnreadable Account Data CardholderData Primary Account Number (PAN) Storage is kept to a minimum as defined inRequirement 3.2 Yes, as defined in Requirement 3.5Cardholder NameStorage is kept to a minimum as defined inRequirement 3.22 No Service CodeExpiration DateSensitiveAuthenticationData Full Track DataCannot be stored after authorization asdefined in Requirement 3.3.13 Yes, data stored until authorization iscomplete must be protected with strongcryptography as defined in Requirement3.3.2 Card verification codePIN PIN BlockIf PAN is stored with other elements of cardholder data, only the PAN must be rendered unreadable according to PCI DSS Requirement3.5.1.Sensitive authentication data must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. This applies even for environments where there is noPAN present.2 Where data exists in the same environment as PAN.3 Except as permitted for issuers and companies that support issuing services. Requirements for issuers and issuing services are separately defined inRequirement 3.3.3.3 Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software StandardsPCI SSC supports the use of secure payment software within cardholder data environments (CDE) via the Software Security Framework(SSF), which consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard. Software that is PCI SSCvalidated and listed provides assurance that the software has been developed using secure practices and has met a defined set of softwaresecurity requirements.The PCI SSC secure software programs include listings of payment software and softwarevendors that have been validated as meeting the applicable PCI SSC Software Standards. Validated Software : Payment software listed on the PCI SSC website as aValidated Payment Application (PA- DSS) or Validated Payment Software (theSecure Software Standard) has been evaluated by a qualified assessor to confirm the software meets the security requirements within that standard. The securityrequirements in these standards are focused on protecting the integrity andconfidentiality of payment transactions and account data. Qualified Software Vendors : The Secure SLC Standard defines securityrequirements for software vendors to integrate secure software development practices throughout the entire software lifecycle. Software vendors that have beenvalidated as meeting the Secure SLC Standard are listed on the PCI SSC websiteas a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.For more information about the SSF or PA -DSS, refer to the respective Program Guides at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.All software that stores, processes, or transmits account data, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data, is in scope for an entity's PCI DSS assessment. While the use of validated payment software supports the security of anentity's CDE, the use of such software does not by itself make an entity PCI DSS compliant. The entity's PCI DSS assessment s hould inc ludeverification that the software is properly configured and securely implemented to support applicable PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, ifPCI-listed payment software has been customized, a more in- depth review will be required during the PCI DSS assessment because thesoftware may no longer be representative of the version that was originally validat ed.Because security threats are constantly evolving, software that is no longer supported by the vendor (for example, identified by the vendor asend of life) may not offer the same level of security as supported versions. Entities are strongly encouraged to keep their software currentand updated to the latest software versions available.Entities that develop their own software are encouraged to refer to PCI SSC's software security standards and consider the requirements therein as best practices to use in their development environments. Secure payment software implemented in a PCI DSS compliantenvironment will help minimize the potential for security breaches leading to compromises of account data and fraud. See Bespoke andCustom Software. Note : PA-DSS and the related program wereretired in October 2022. Refer to the PCI SSCList of Validated Payment Applications forexpiry dates for PA -DSS validatedapplications . Since the expiry date,applications are listed as Acceptable only forPre-Existing Deployments. Whether an entitycan continue to use a PA -DSS application withan expired listing is at the discretion oforganizations that manage complianceprograms (such as payment brands andacquirers ); entities should contact theseorganizations for more details.Applicability of PCI DSS to Payment Software VendorsPCI DSS may apply to a payment software vendor if the vendor is also a service provider that stores , process es, or transmit s account data, orhas access to their customers' account data-for example, in the role of a payment service provider or via remote access to a customerenvironment . Software vendors to which PCI DSS may be applicable include those offering payment services, as well as cloud serviceproviders offering payment terminals in the cloud, software as a service (SaaS), e- commerce in the cloud, and other cloud payment services.Bespoke and Custom SoftwareAll bespoke and custom software that stores, processes, or transmits accountdata, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data, is in scope for an entity's PCI DSS assessment.Bespoke and custom software that has been developed and maintained in accordance with one of PCI SSC's Software Security Framework standards (the Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC standard) will support anentity in meeting PCI DSS Requirement 6.See Appendix F for more details. Note : PCI DSS Requirement 6 fully applies to bespokeand custom software that has not been developed andmaintained in accordance with one of PCI SSC's SoftwareSecurity Framework standards. Entities that use softwarevendors to develop bespoke or custom software thatcould impact the security of their cardholder data and orsensitive authentication data are responsible for ensuringthose software vendors develop the software according toPCI DSS Requirement 6.4 Scope of PCI DSS RequirementsPCI DSS requirements apply to: The cardholder data environment (CDE), which is comprised of:- System components, people, and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data,and,- System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD SAD but have unrestricted connectivity to system componentsthat store, process, or transmit CHD SAD.AND System components, people, and processes that could impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data.4System components include network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, cloud components, and software. Examplesof system components include but are not limited to: Systems that store, process, or transmit account data (for example, payment terminals, authorization systems, clearing systems,payment middleware systems, payment back -office systems, shopping cart and store front systems, payment gateway switch systems,fraud monitoring systems). Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers, access control servers, security information and eventmanagement (SIEM) systems, physical security systems (for example, badge access or CCTV), multi -factor authentication systems,anti-malware systems). Systems that facilitate segmentation (for example, internal network security controls). Systems that could impact the security of account data or the CDE (for example, name resolution, or e- commerce (web) redirectionservers). Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications desktops, andhypervisors. Cloud infrastructure and components, both external and on premises, and including instantiations of containers or images, vir tualprivate clouds, cloud- based identity and access management, CDEs residing on premises or in the cloud, service meshes withcontainerized applications, and container orchestration tools.4 For additional guidance, refer to Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation on the PCI SSC website. Network components, including but not limited to network security controls, switches, routers, VoIP network devices, wireless accesspoints, network appliances, and other security appliances. Server types, including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network Time Protocol (NTP), andDomain Name System (DNS). End-user devices, such as computers, laptops, workstations, administrative workstations, tablets, and mobile devices. Printers, and multi -function devices that scan, print, and fax. Storage of account data in any format (for example, paper, data files, audio files, images, and video recordings). Applications, software, and software components, serverless applications, including all purchased, subscribed (for example, S oftware-as-a-Service), bespoke and custom software, including internal and external (for example, Internet) applications. Tools, code repositories, and systems that implement software configuration management or for deployment of objects to the CD E or tosystems that can impact the CDE.Figure 1 shows considerations for scoping system components for PCI DSS.Figure 1. Understanding PCI DSS ScopingAnnual PCI DSS Scope ConfirmationThe first step in preparing for a PCI DSS assessment is for the entity to accurately determine the scope of the review. The assessed entitymust confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2 by identifying all locations and flows of accountdata, and identifying all systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication servers, remoteaccess servers, logging servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All types of systems and locations should be consideredduring the scoping process, including backup recovery sites and fail -over systems.The minimum steps for an entity to confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope are specified in PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2. The entity is expected to retain documentation to show how PCI DSS scope was determined. The documentation is retained for assessor review and forreference during the entity's next PCI DSS scope confirmation activity. For each PCI DSS assessment, the assessor validates that the entity accurately defined and documented the scope of the assessment.Note : This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is defined at PCI DSS Requirement at 12.5.2 and is an activity expected to be per formed bythe entity. This activity is not the same, nor is it intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation performed by the entity's assessor duringthe assessment.SegmentationSegmentation (or isolation) of the CDE from the remainder of an entity's network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is stronglyrecommended as a method that may reduce the: Scope of the PCI DSS assessment Cost of the PCI DSS assessment Cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls Risk to an organization relative to payment account data (reduced by consolidating that data into fewer, more controlled locations)Without adequate segmentation (sometimes called a flat network) , the entire network is in scope for the PCI DSS assessment. S egmentationcan be achieved using a number of physical or logical methods, such as properly configured internal network security controls, routers with strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network. To be considered out of scope for PCI DSS, a system component must be properly segmented (isolated) from the CDE, such that the out -of-scope system component could notimpact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data, even if that component was compromised.An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the CDE is a clear understanding of business needs and processes related to the storage,processing, and transmission of account data. Restricting account data to as few locations as possible by eliminating unnecessary data andconsolidating necessary data may require reengineering of long- standing business practices.Documenting account data flows via a data- flow diagram helps an entity fully understand how account data comes into an organization, whereit resides within the organization, and how it traverses through various systems within the organization. Data- flow diagrams also illustrate alllocations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted. This information supports an entity implementing segmentation and canalso support confirming that segmentation is being used to isolate the CDE from out -of-scope networks.If segmentation is used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the segmentation is adequate toreduce the scope of the assessment, as illustrated in Figure 2. At a high level, adequate segmentation isolates systems that store, process, ortransmit account data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific segmentation implementation is highly variable anddepends on several factors such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may be implemented.Figure 2. Segmentation and Impact to PCI DSS ScopeWirelessIf wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit account data (for example, wireless point -of-sale devices), or if a wireless localarea network (WLAN) is part of or connected to the CDE, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for sec uring wirelessenvironments apply and must be performed.Rogue wireless detection must be performed per PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1 even when wireless is not used within the CDE and t he entityhas a policy that prohibits the use of wireless technology within its environment. This is because of the ease with which a wireless accesspoint can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting its presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorize d wireless devices.Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Considerdeploying wireless technology only for non- sensitive data transmission.When Cardholder Data and or Sensitive Authentication Data is Accidentally Received via anUnintended ChannelThere could be occurrences where an entity receives cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data unsolicited via an insecurecommunication channel that was not intended for the purpose of receiving sensitive data. In this situation, the entity can choose to either : Include the channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it according to PCI DSSOr Securely delete the data and implement measures to prevent the channel from being used in the future for sending such data.Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact on PCI DSS ScopeEncryption of cardholder data with strong cryptography is an acceptable method of rendering the data unreadable according to PCI DSSRequirement 3.5. However, encryption alone is generally insufficient to render the cardholder data out of scope for PCI DSS and does notremove the need for PCI DSS in that environment. The entity's environment is still in scope for PCI DSS due to the presence of cardholderdata. For example, for a merchant card- present environment, there is physical access to the payment cards to complete a transaction andthere may also be paper reports or receipts with cardholder data. Similarly, in merchant card- not-present environments, such as mail -order telephone- order and e- commerce, payment card details are provided via channels that n eed to be evaluated and protected according toPCI DSS.The following are each in scope for PCI DSS: Systems performing encryption and or decryption of cardholder data, and systems performing key management functions, Encrypted cardholder data that is not isolated from the encryption and decryption and key management processes, Encrypted cardholder data that is present on a system or media that also contains the decryption key, Encrypted cardholder data that is present in the same environment as the decryption key, Encrypted cardholder data that is accessible to an entity that also has access to the decryption key.Note : A PCI -listed P2PE solution can significantly reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to a merchant's cardholder dataenvironment. However, it does not completely remove the applicability of PCI DSS in the merchant environment.Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact to PCI DSS Scope for Third -Party Service ProvidersWhere a third- party service provider (TPSP) receives and or stores only data encrypted by another entity, and where they do not have theability to decrypt the data, the TPSP may be able to consider the encrypted data out of scope if certain conditions are met. This is becauseresponsibility for the data generally remains with the entity, or entities, with the ability to decrypt the data or impact the security of theencry pted data. Determining which party is responsible for specific PCI DSS controls will depend on several factors, including who has accessto the decryption keys, the role performed by each party, and the agreement between parties. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and documented to ensure both the TPSP and the entity providing the encrypted data understand which entity is responsible for which securitycontrols.As an example, a TPSP providing storage services receives and stores encrypted cardholder data provided by customers for back -uppurposes. This TPSP does not have access to the encryption or decryption keys, nor does it perform any key management for its customers.The TPSP can exclude any such encrypted data when determining its PCI DSS scope. However, the TPSP does maintain responsibili ty forcontrolling access to the encrypted data storage as part of its service agreements with its customers.Responsibility for ensuring that the encrypted data and the cryptographic keys are protected according to applicable PCI DSS requirements isoften shared between entities. In the above example, the customer determines which of their personnel are authorized to access the storagemedia, and the storage facility is responsible for managing the physical and or logical access controls to ensure that only persons authorizedby the customer are granted access to the storage media. The specific PCI DSS requirements applicable to a TPSP will depend on the services provided and the agreement between the two parties. In the example of a TPSP providing storage services, the physical and logicalaccess controls provided by the TPSP will need to be reviewed at least annually. This review could be performed as part of the merchant'sPCI DSS assessment or, alternatively, the review could be performed, and controls validated, by the TPSP with appropriate evidence providedto the merchant. For information about appropriate evidence, see Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Servicesthat Meet Customers' PCI DSS Requirements .As another example, a TPSP that receives only encrypted cardholder data for the purposes of routing to other entities, and that does not have access to the data or cryptographic keys, may not have any PCI DSS responsibility for that encrypted data. In this scenario, where the TPSPis not providing any security services or access controls, they may be considered the same as a public or untrusted network, and it would be the responsibility of the entity(s) sending receiving account data through the TPSP's network to ensure PCI DSS controls are applied toprotect the data being transmitted.Use of Third-Party Service ProvidersAn entity (referred to as the customer in this section) might cho ose to use a third -party service provider (TPSP) to store, process, or transmitaccount data or to manage in- scope system components on the customer's behalf. Use of a TPSP may have an impact on the security of acustomer's CDE.Note : Use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make a customer PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the customer's responsibility forits own PCI DSS compliance. Even if a customer uses a TPSP, that customer remains responsible for confirming its own compliance asrequested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers ). Customers should contact theseorganizations for any requirements.Using TPSPs and the Impact on Customers Meeting PCI DSS Requirement 12.8There are many different scenarios where a customer might use one or more TPSPs for functions within or related to the custom er's CDE.In all scenarios where a TPSP is used, the customer must manage and oversee all their TPSP relationships and monitor the PCI DSScompliance status of their TPSPs in accordance with Requirement 12.8, including TPSPs that: Have access to the customer's CDE, Manage in- scope system components on the customer's behalf, and or Can impact the security of the customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data .Managing TPSP relationships in accordance with Requirement 12.8 includes performing due diligence, having appropriate agreements inplace, identifying which requirements apply to the customer and which apply to the TPSP, and monitoring the compliance status of TPSPsat least annual ly.Requirement 12.8 does not specify that the customer's TPSPs must be PCI DSS compliant, only that the customer monitor s theircompliance status as specified in the requirement. Therefore, a TPSP do es not need to be PCI DSS compliant for its customer to meetRequirement 12.8.Impact of Using TPSPs for Services that Meet Customers' PCI DSS RequirementsWhen the TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer's behalf or where that service may impact thesecurity of the customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data, then those requirements are in scope for the customer'sassessment and the compliance of that service will impact the customer's PCI DSS compliance. The TPSP must demonstrate it meets applicable PCI DSS requirements for those requirements to be in place for its customers. For example, if an entity engages a TPSP tomanage its network security controls, and the TPSP does not provide evidence that it meets the applicable requirements in PCI DSSRequirement 1, then those requirements are not in place for the customer's assessment. As another example, TPSPs that store backups of cardholder data on behalf of customers would need to meet the applicable requirements related to access controls, physical security, etc.,for their customers to consider those requirements in place for their assessments.Importance of Understanding Responsibilities Between TPSP Customers and TPSPsWhen a TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer's behalf or where that service may impact the security of the customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data, it is important that c ustomers and TPSPs clearly identify andunderstand the following: The services and system components included in the scope of the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment , The specific PCI DSS requirements and sub- requirements covered by the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment, Any requirements that are the responsibility of the TPSP's customers to include in their own PCI DSS assessments, and Any PCI DSS requirements for which the responsibility is shared between the TPSP and its customers.For example, a cloud provider should clearly define which of its IP addresses are scanned as part of its quarterly vulnerability scan process and which IP addresses are their customers' responsibility to scan.Per Requirement 12.9.2, TPSPs are required to support their customers' requests for information about the TPSP's PCI DSS comp liancestatus related to the services provided to customers, and about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP, which are the responsibility of the customer, and any responsibilities shared between the customer and the TPSP. Refer to Information Supplement:Third -Party Security Assurance for a sample responsibility matrix template that may be used for documenting and clarifying howresponsibilities are shared between TPSPs and customers.Note that not all TPSP relationships require that TPSPs provide customers with documentation of how responsibilities are shared between TPSPsand customers . TPSPs are only required to share such documentation if that TPSP is meeting a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer's behalf ,if responsibility for meeting a PCI DSS requirement is shared between the TPSP and its customer, or if the TPSP's service may impact the securityof the customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data. While a TPSP may not be required to provide its customers with suchdocumentation because there are no shared responsibilities, the TPSP still needs to support customers by providing their PCI DSS compliancestatus information, so that customers can manage and monitor their TPSPs in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.8.Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services that Meet Customers' PCI DSSRequirementsTPSPs are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (forexample, payment brands and acquirers). TPSPs should contact these organizations for any requirements.When a TPSP provides services that are intended to meet or facilitate meeting a customer's PCI DSS requirements or that may i mpact thesecurity of a customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data , these requirements are in scope for the customer's PCI DSSassessments. There are two options for TPSPs to validate compliance in this scenario: Annual assessment : TPSP undergoes an annual PCI DSS assessment(s) and provides evidence to its customers to show the TPSPmeets the applicable PCI DSS requirements; or Multiple, on -demand assessments: If a TPSP does not undergo an annual PCI DSS assessment, it must undergo assessmentsupon request of their customers and or participate in each of its customers' PCI DSS assessments, with the results of each review provided to the respective customer(s).If the TPSP undergoes its own PCI DSS assessment, it is expected to provide sufficient evidence to its customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer, and that the relevant PCI DSS requir ements wereexamined and determined to be in place. If the provider has an PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance ( AOC ), it is expected that the TPSPprovides the AOC to customers upon request. The customer may also request relevant sections of the TPSP's PCI D SS Report onCompliance (ROC). The ROC may be redacted to protect any confidential information.If the TPSP does not undergo its own PCI DSS assessment and therefore does not have an AOC, the TPSP is expected to provide s pecificevidence related to the applicable PCI DSS requirements, so that the customer (or its assessor) is able to confirm that the TPSP is meetingthose PCI DSS requirements.TPSP' s Presence on a Payment Brand List (s) of PCI DSS Compliant Service ProvidersFor a customer that is monitoring a TPSP's compliance status in accordance with Requirement 12.8, the TPSP's presence on a paymentbrand's list of PCI DSS compliant service providers may be sufficient evidence of the TPSP's compliance status if it is clear from the listthat the services applicable to the customer were covered by the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment. If it is not clear from the list, the customer should obtain other written confirmation that addresses the TPSP's PCI DSS compliance status.For a customer that is looking for evidence of PCI DSS compliance for requirements that a TPSP meets on a customer's behalf or wherethe service provided can impact the security of the customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data, the TPSP's presenceon a payment brand's list of PCI DSS compl iant service providers is not sufficient evidence that the applicable PCI DSS requirements forthat TPSP were included in the assessment. If the TPSP has an PCI DSS AOC, it is expected to provide it t o customers upon request.5 Best Practices for Implementing PCI DSS into Business- as-Usual ProcessesAn entity that implements business -as-usual processes, otherwise known as BAU, as part of their overall security strategy is taking measuresto ensure that the security controls implemented to secure data and an environment continue to be implemented correctly and functioningproperly as normal course of business.Some PCI DSS requirements are intended to act as BAU processes by monitoring security controls to ensure their effectiveness on anongoing basis. This oversight by the entity assists with providing reasonable assurance that the compliance of its environment is preservedbetween PCI DSS assessments. While there are currently some BAU requirements defined within the standard, an entity should ad optadditional BAU processes specific to their organization and environment when possible. BAU processes are a way t o verify that automatedand manual controls are performing as expected. Regardless of whether a PCI DSS requirement is automated or manual, it is imp ortant forBAU processes to detect anomalies, and alert and report so that responsible individuals address the situation in a timely manner.Examples of how PCI DSS should be incorporated into BAU activities include , but are not limited to: Assigning overall responsibility and accountability for PCI DSS compliance to an individual or team. This can include a charter definedby executive management for a specific PCI DSS compliance program and communication to executive management. Developing performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security initiatives and continuous monitoring of security controls, including those that are heavily relied upon, such as network security controls, intrusion- detection systems intrusion- preve ntion systems(IDS IPS), change -detection mechanisms , anti-malware solutions , and access controls, to ensure they are operating effectively and asintended. Reviewing logged data more frequently to gain insights to trends or behaviors that may not be obvious with only monitoring. Ensuring that all failures in security controls are detected and responded to promptly. Processes to respond to security cont rol failuresshould include:- Restoring the security control .- Identifying the cause of failure.- Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure of the security control .- Implementing mitigation, such as process or technical controls, to prevent the cause of the failure from recurring.- Resuming monitoring of the security control, perhaps with enhanced monitoring for a period of time, to verify the control is operatingeffectively . Reviewing changes that could introduce security risks to the environment (for example, addition of new systems, changes in sy stem ornetwork configurations) prior to completing the change, and including the following:- Perform a risk assessment to determine the potential impact to PCI DSS scope (for example, a new network security control rul ethat permits connectivity between a system in the CDE and another system could bring additional systems or networks into scop efor PCI DSS).- Identify PCI DSS requirements applicable to systems and networks affected by the changes (for example, if a new system is inscope for PCI DSS, it would need to be configured per system configuration standards, including change- detection mechanisms,anti-malware software, patches, and audit logging. These new systems and networks would need to be added to the inventory of in-scope system components and to the quarterly vulnerability scan schedule).- Update PCI DSS scope and implement security controls as appropriate.- Update documentation to reflect implemented changes. Reviewing the impact to PCI DSS scope and requirements upon changes to organizational structure (for example, a company mergeror acquisition). Reviewing external connections and third- party access periodically. For entities that use third parties for software development, periodically confirming that those software development activit ies continueto comply with software development requirements in Requirement 6. Performing periodic reviews to confirm that PCI DSS requirements continue to be in place and personnel follow established processes. Periodic reviews should cover all facilities and locations, including retail outlets and data centers, whether self -managed or if a TPSP isused. For example, periodic reviews can be used to confirm that configuration standards have been applied to applicable systems,default vendor accounts and passwords are removed or disabled, patches and anti -malware solutions are up to date, audit logs arebeing reviewed, and so on. The frequency of periodic reviews should be determined by the entity as appropriate for the size andcomplexity of their environment, if not otherwise stated in PCI DSS.These reviews can also be used to verify that required evidence for a PCI DSS assessment is being maintained. For example, ev idence ofaudit logs, vulnerability scan reports, and reviews of network security control rulesets are necessary to assist the entity in preparing for its nextPCI DSS assessment. Establishing communication with all impacted parties, both external and internal, about newly identified threats and changes to the organization structure. Communication materials should help recipients understand the impact of threats, mitigating steps, and contactpoints for further information or escalation. Reviewing hardware and software technologies at least once every 12 months to confirm that they continue to be supported by t hevendor and can meet the entity's security requirements, including PCI DSS. If technologies are no longer supported by the ven dor orcannot meet the entity's security needs, the entity should prepare a remediation plan, including replacement of the technology, asnecessary.Note : Some best practices in this section are also included as PCI DSS requirements for certain entities. For example, those undergoing a fullPCI DSS assessment, service providers validating to the additional service provider only requirements, and designated entities that arerequired to validate according to Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation.Each entity should consider implementing these best practices into their environment, even if the entity is not required to validate to them (forexample, merchants undergoing self -assessment).Refer to Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website for additional guidance.6 For Assessors: Sampling for PCI DSS AssessmentsSampling is an option for assessors conducting PCI DSS assessments to facilitate the assessment process when there are large numbers ofitems in a population being tested.While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample from similar items in a population being tested as part of its review of an entity's PCI DSScompliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of its environment ( for example, requirements forquarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to review only a sample of PCIDSS requirements for compliance.While sampling allows assessors to test less than 100 of a given sampling population, assessors should always strive for the most completereview possible. Assessors are encouraged to use automated processes or other mechanisms if the complete population, regardless of size,can be tested quickly and efficiently with minimal impact on the resources of the entity being assessed. Where automated proc esses are notavailable to test 100 of a population, sampling is an equally acceptable approach.After considering the overall scope, complexity, and consistency of the environment being assessed, and the nature (automated or manual) ofthe processes used by an entity to meet a requirement, the assessor may independently select representative samples from the populationsbeing reviewed in order to assess the entity's compliance with PCI DSS requirements. Samples must be a representative selecti on of allvariants of the population and must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expectedacross the entire population. Where testing the periodic performance of a requirement (for example, weekly or quarterly, or p eriodically), theassessor should attempt to select a sample that represents the entire peri od covered by the assessment so that the assessor may make areasonable judgment that the requirement was met throughout the assessment period. Testing the same sample of items year after year couldallow unknown variations in the non- sampled items to rema in undetected. Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for eachassessment and consider previous sample sets. Different samples must be selected for each assessment.Appropriate selection of the sample depends on what is being considered in examining the sample members. For example, determi ning thepresence of anti -malware on servers known to be affected by malicious software may lead to determining the population to be all servers inthe environment, or all servers in the environment that are running a particular operating system, or all servers that are not mainframes, et c.Selection of an appropriate sample would then include representatives of ALL members of the identified population, including all serversrunning the identified operating system including all versions, as well as servers within the population that are used for di fferent functions ( forexample, web server s, application servers, and database servers).In the case that a specific configuration item is being considered, the population might be appropriately divided, and separate sample groupsidentified. For example, a sample of all servers may not be appropriate when reviewing an operating system configuration sett ing, wheredifferent operating systems are present within the environment. In this case, samples from e ach operating system type would be appropriate inidentifying that the configuration has been appropriately set for each operating system. Eac h sample set should include servers that arerepresentative of each operating system type, including version, as well as representative functions.Other examples of sampling include selections of personnel with similar or varied roles, based on the requirement being asses sed, forexample, a sample of administrators vs. a sample of all employees.The assessor is required to use professional judgment in the planning, performance, and evaluation of the sample to support t heir conclusionabout whether and how the entity has met a requirement. The assessor's goal in sampling is to obtain enough evidenc e to have a reasonablebasis for their opinion. When independently selecting samples, assessors should consider the following: The assessor must select the sample from the complete population without influence from the assessed entity. If the entity has standardized processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and which is applied to each item in t hepopulation, the sample can be smaller than if the entity has no standardized processes controls in place. The sample must be largeenough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that items in the population adhere to the standardized processes that areapplied to each item in the population. The assessor must verify that the standardized controls are implemented and worki ng effectively. If the entity has more than one type of standardized process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities system components), the sample must include items subject to each type of process. For example, populations could be divided into sub-populations based on characteristics that may impact the consistency of the assessed requirements, such as the use of different processes or tools. Samples would then be selected from each sub- population. If the entity has no standardized PCI DSS processes controls in place and each item in the population is managed through non-standardized processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that the PCI DSS requirements are appropriat elyapplied to each item in the population. Samples of system components must include every type and combination being used. When an entity has more than one CDE,samples must include populations across all in- scope system components. For example, where applications are sampled, the samplemust include all versions and platforms for each type of application. Sample sizes must always be greater than one unless there is only one item in the given population, or an automated control i s usedwhere the assessor has confirmed the control is functioning as programmed for each assessed sample population. If the assessor relies on standardized processes and controls being in place as a basis for selecting a sample, but then finds out duringtesting that standardized processes and controls are not in place or not operating effectively, the assessor should th en increase thesample size to attempt to gain assurance that PCI DSS requirements are being met.For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must: Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size. Validate and document the standardized processes and controls used to determine sample size. Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.Figure 3 shows considerations for determining sample size.Figure 3. PCI DSS Sampling ConsiderationsNote : In PCI DSS v4.0, specific references to sampling have been removed from all testing procedures. These references were removedbecause calling out sampling only in some testing procedures may have implied that sampling was mandatory for those testing procedures(which it was not) or that sampling was only allowable where it was specifically mentioned. Assessors should select samples when it isappropriate to the population being tested, and, per above, render those decisions after considering the overall scope and complexity of anenvironment.7 Description of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS RequirementsCertain PCI DSS requirements have been established with specific timeframes for activities that need to be performed consistently via aregularly scheduled and repeatable process. The intent is that the activity is performed at an interval as close to that timeframe as possiblewithout exceeding it. The entity has the discretion to perform an activity more often than specified (for example, performing an activity monthlywhere the PCI DSS requirement specifies it be performed every three months).Table 4 outlines the frequency for the different time periods used in PCI DSS Requirements.Table 4. PCI DSS Requirement TimeframesTimeframes in PCI DSSRequirements Descriptions and ExamplesDaily Every day of the year (not only on business days).Weekly At least once every seven days.Monthly At least once every 30 to 31 days, or on the nth day of the month.Every three months(quarterly) At least once every 90 to 92 days, or on the nth day of each third month.Every six months At least once every 180 to 184 days, or on the nth day of each sixth month.Every 12 months (annually) At least once every 365 (or 366 for leap years) days or on the same date every year.Periodically Frequency of occurrence is at the entity's discretion and is documented and supported by the entity's risk analysis . The entitymust demonstrate that the frequency is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of the requirement .Immediately Without delay. In real time or near real time.Promptly As soon as reasonably possible.Timeframes in PCI DSSRequirements Descriptions and ExamplesSignificant change There are several requirements that specify activities to be perform ed upon a significant change in an entity's environment.While what constitutes a significant change is highly dependent on the configuration of a given environment, each of thefollowing activities, at a minimum, has potential impacts on the security of the CDE and must be considered and evaluated todetermine whether a change is a significant change for an entity in the context of related PCI DSS requirements: New hardware, software, or networking equipment added to the CDE. Any replacement or major upgrades of hardware and or software in the CDE. Any changes in the flow or storage of account data. Any changes to the boundary of the CDE and or to the scope of the PCI DSS assessment. Any changes to the underlying supporting infrastructure of the CDE (including, but not limited to, changes to directory services, time servers, logging, and monitoring). Any changes to third- party vendors service providers (or services provided) that support the CDE or meet PCI DSSrequirements on behalf of the entity.For other PCI DSS requirements, where the standard does not define a minimum frequency for recurring activities but instead allows for therequirement to be met periodically, the entity is expected to define the frequency as appropriate for its business. The frequency defined bythe entity must be supported by the entity's security policy and the risk analysis conducted according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1. Theentity must also be able to demonstrate that the frequency it has defined is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent ofthe requirement.In both cases, where PCI DSS specifies a required frequency and where PCI DSS allows for periodic performance, the entity is expected to have documented and implemented processes to ensure that activities are performed within a reasonable timeframe, incl uding at least thefollowing: The entity is promptly notified any time an activity is not performed per its defined schedule, The entity determines the events that led to missing a scheduled activity, The entity performs the activity as soon as possible after it is missed and either gets back on schedule or establishes a new schedule, The entity produces documentation that shows the above elements occurred.When an entity has the above processes in place to detect and address when a scheduled activity is missed, a reasonable approach is allowable, meaning that if an activity is required to be performed at least once every three months, the entity is not automatically non-compliant if the activity is performed late where the entity's documented and implemented process (per above) was followed. H owever, whereno such process is in place and or the activity was not performed according to schedule due to oversight, mismanagement, or lack ofmonitoring, the entity has not met the requirement. In such cases, the requirement will only be in place when the entity 1) documents (orreconfirms) the process per above to ensure the scheduled activity occurs on time, 2) re- establishes the schedule, and 3) provides evidencethat the entity has performed the scheduled activity at least once per their schedule.Note : Where an entity is being assessed for the first time against a PCI DSS requirement with a defined timeframe, it is considered an initialPCI DSS assessment for that requirement. This means the entity has never undergone a prior assessment to that requirem ent, where theassessment resulted in submission of a compliance validation document (for example, an AOC, SAQ, or ROC).For an initial assessment against a requirement that has a defined timeframe, it is not required that the activity has been performed for everysuch timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies: The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the mostrecent three- month or six -month period), and The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe.For subsequent years after the initial assessment, the activity must have been performed at least once within each required timeframe. Forexample, an activity required at least every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at aninterval that does not exceed 90- 92 days.8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSSTo support flexibility in how security objectives are met, there are two approaches for implementing and validating to PCI DSS. Entities shouldidentify the approach best suited to their security implementation and use that approach to validate the control s.DefinedApproach Follows the traditional method for implementing and validating PCI DSS and uses the Requirements and Testing Procedures defined within the standard. In the defined approach, the entity implements security controls to meet the stated requirements ,and the assessor follows the defined testing procedures to verify that requirements have been met.The defined approach supports entities with controls in place that meet PCI DSS requirements as stated. This approach may also suit entities that want more direction about how to meet security objectives, as well as entities new to information sec urityor PCI DSS.Compensating ControlsAs part of the defined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated due to a legitimate and documented technical or business constraint may implement other, or compensating, controls , that sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with not meetingthe requirement. On an annual basis, any compensating controls must be documented by the entity and reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report onCompliance submission. Note : For more details,see Appendix B :Compensating Controlsand Appendix C :Compensating ControlsWorksheet .CustomizedApproach Focuses on the Objective of each PCI DSS requirement (if applicable) , allowing entities toimplement controls to meet the requirement's stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does not strictly follow the defined requirement. Because each customizedimplementation will be different, there are no defined testing procedures; the assessor isrequired to derive testing procedures that are appropriate to the specific implementation tovalidate that the implemented controls meet the stated Objective.The customized approach supports innovation in security practices, allowing entities greaterflexibility to show how their current security controls meet PCI DSS objectives. This approachis intended for risk -mature entities that demonstrate a robust risk -management approach to security, including, but not limited to,a dedicated risk -management department or an organization- wide risk management approach.The controls implemented and validated using the customized approach are expected to meet or exceed the security provided by the requirement in the defined approach. The level of documentation and effort required to validate customizedimplementations will also be greater than for the defined approach Note : For more details,see Appendix D :Customized Approach andPCI DSS v4.x: SampleTemplates to SupportCustomized Approach onthe PCI SSC website.Most PCI DSS requirements can be met using either the defined or customized approach. However, several requirements do not have astated Customized Approach Objective; the customized approach is not an option for these requirements.Entities can use both the defined and customized approaches within their environment. This means an entity could use the defi ned approachto meet some requirements and use the customized approach to meet other requirements. This also means that an entity could us e thedefined approach to meet a given PCI DSS requirement for one system component or within one environment and use the customizedapproach to meet that same PCI DSS requirement for a different system component or within a different environment. In this way, a PCI DSSassessment could include both defined and customized testing procedures.Figure 4 shows the two validation options for PCI DSS v4. x.Figure 4. PCI DSS Validation Approaches9 Protecting Information About an Entity's Security PostureThe processes related to becoming and maintaining a PCI DSS compliant environment results in many artifacts that an entity may considersensitive and may want to protect as such, including such items as the following: The Report on Compliance or Self -Assessment Questionnaire (the associated Attestation of Compliance is not considered sensitive andthird-party service providers (TPSPs) are expected to share their AOC with customers). Network diagrams and account data- flow diagrams, and security configurations and rules. System configuration standards. Cryptography and key management methods and protocols.Entities should review all the artifacts related to PCI DSS controls or the assessment and protect them in accordance with th e entity's securitypolicies for this type of information.TPSPs are required (PCI DSS Requirement 12.9) to support their customers with the following: Information needed for customers to monitor the TPSPs' PCI DSS compliance status (to enable the customer to comply with Requirement 12.8), and Evidence that the TPSP is meeting applicable PCI DSS requirements where the TPSP 's services are intended to meet or facilitatemeeting a customer's PCI DSS requirements, or where those services may impact the security of a customer's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data.This section does not impact or negate a TPSP's obligation to support and provide information to their customers per Requirement 12.9.For more details about expectations for TPSPs and relationships between TPSPs and customers, see Use of Third- Party Service Providers .Protection of C onfidential and S ensitive Information by Qualified Security Assessor CompaniesEach Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Company signs an agreement with PCI SSC that they will adhere to the Qualification Req uirementsfor QSAs . The Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information section of that document includes the following:The QSA company must have and adhere to a documented process for protection of confidential and sensitive information. This must include adequate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards consistent with industry -accepted practices to protect confidential andsensitive information against any threats or unauthorized access during storage, processing, and or communicating of this inf ormation.The QSA Company must maintain the privacy and confidentiality of information obtained in the course of performing its duties andobligations as a QSA Company, unless (and to the extent) disclosure is required by legal authority.10 Testing Methods for PCI DSS RequirementsThe testing methods identified in the Testing Procedures for each requirement describe the expected activities to be performe d by theassessor to determine whether the entity has met the requirement. The intent behind each testing method is described as follows: Examine: The assessor critically evaluates data evidence. Common examples include documents (electronic or physical), screens hots,configuration files, audit logs , and data files. Observe: The assessor watches an action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation subjects include personnelperforming a task or process, system components performing a function or responding to input, environmental conditions, and physicalcontrols. Interview: The assessor converses with individual personnel. Interview objectives may include confirmation of whether an acti vity isperformed, descriptions of how an activity is performed, and whether personnel have particular knowledge or understanding.The testing methods are intended to allow the assessed entity to demonstrate how they have met a requirement. They also provi de theassessed entity and the assessor with a common understanding of the assessment activities to be performed. The specific items to be examined or observed and personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for both the requirement being assessed and each e ntity'sparticular implementation. When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the testing activities performed and the result of each activity.11 Instructions and Content for Report on ComplianceInstructions and content for the Report on Compliance (ROC) are provided in the PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template.The PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template must be used as the template for creating a PCI DSS Report on Compliance.Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizat ions that managecompliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers ). Entities should contact these organizations to determine any reportingrequirements and instructions.12 PCI DSS Assessment ProcessThe PCI DSS assessment process includes the following high- level steps :5"

These are identified within the requirement as Additionalrequirement for service providers only and apply in addition to all other applicable requirements. Where the entity being assessed is both amerchant and a service provider, requirements noted as Additional requirement for service providers only apply to the service providerportion of the entity's business. Requirements identified with Additional requirement for service providers only are also recommended as bestpractices for consideration by all entities.Appendices with Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Different Types of EntitiesIn addition to the 12 principal requirements, PCI DSS Appendix A contains additional PCI DSS requirements for different types of entities. Thesections within Appendix A include: Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi -Tenant Service Providers . Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities using SSL Early TLS for Card- Present POS POI Terminal Connections . Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV) .Build and Maintain a Secure Network and SystemsRequirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security ControlsSections1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.OverviewNetwork security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement p oints thattypically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre- defined polic ies or rules .NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether thenetwork traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different securityneeds or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policydecisions.Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud access controls, virtualization container systems, and other software- defined networking technology.NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity's own networks -for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas -and also toprotect the entity's resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitivearea within an entity's network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways intosensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business -to-business communication channels,wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third- party networks, and other sources outside the entity's ability to control . Furthermore,untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out -of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, andtherefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider aninternal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considereduntrusted for PCI DSS.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood .Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 1.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 1.While it is important to define the specific policiesor procedures called out in Requirement 1, it is equally important to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For thesereasons, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cy cle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define thecontrols, methods, and processes that arefollowed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 1.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 1 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 1.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 1 are managed in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 1 are defined,understood, and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintainedwithin separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 1.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 1 are documented, assigned, and understood. 1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 1 are documented and assigned.1.1.2.b Interview personnel responsible forperforming activities in Requirement 1 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 1 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe implementation of these configurationstandards results in the NSC being configured and managed to properly perform their securityfunction (often referred to as the ruleset).Good PracticeThese standards often define the requirements foracceptable protocols, ports that are permitted to be used, and specific configuration requirements that are acceptable. Configuration standards may also outline what the entity considers notacceptable or not permitted within its network.DefinitionsNSCs are key components of a networkarchitecture. Most commonly, NSCs are used at the boundaries of the CDE to control network traffic flowing inbound and outbound from the CDE.Configuration standards outline an entity'sminimum requirements for the configuration of itsNSCs .ExamplesExamples of NSCs covered by these configuration standards include, but are not limited to, firewalls, routers configured with access control lists, and cloud virtual networks. 1.2.1 Configuration standards for NSC rulesets are: Defined . Implemented . Maintained. 1.2.1.a Examine the configuration standards forNSC rulesets to verify the standards are inaccordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.1.2.1.b Examine configuration settings for NSCrulesets to verify that rulesets are implemented according to the configuration standards.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe way that NSCs are configured and operate aredefined and consistently applied.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFollowing a structured change control process forall changes to NSCs reduces the risk that a change could introduce a security vulnerability.Good PracticeChanges should be approved by individuals withthe appropriate authority and knowledge tounderstand the impact of the change. Verificationshould provide reasonable assurance that thechange did not adversely impact the security ofthe network and that the change performs asexpected.To avoid having to address security issuesintroduced by a change, all changes should beapproved prior to being implemented and verified after the change is implemented. Once approved and verified, network documentation should be updated to include the changes to prevent inconsistencies between network documentation and the actual configuration. 1.2.2 All changes to network connections and toconfigurations of NSCs are approved and managed in accordance with the change control process defined at Requirement 6.5.1. 1.2.2.a Examine documented procedures to verifythat changes to network connections andconfigurations of NSCs are included in the formalchange control process in accordance with Requirement 6.5.1.1.2.2.b Examine network configuration settings toidentify changes made to network connections. Interview responsible personnel and examinechange control records to verify that identifiedchanges to network connections were approvedand managed in accordance wit h Requirement6.5.1.1.2.2.c Examine network configuration settings toidentify changes made to configurations of NSCs.Interview responsible personnel and examinechange control records to verify that identifiedchanges to configurations of NSC s were approvedand managed in accordance with Requirement 6.5.1. Customized Approach ObjectiveChanges to network connections and NSCs cannot result in misconfiguration, implementation of insecure services, or unauthorized network connections.Applicability NotesChanges to network connections include theaddition, removal, or modification of a connection.Changes to NSC configurations include thoserelated to the component itself as well as thoseaffecting how it performs its security function.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMaintaining an accurate and up-to -date networkdiagram(s) prevents network connections anddevices from being overlooked and unknowinglyleft unsecured and vulnerable to compromise.A properly maintained network diagram(s) helps an organization verify its PCI DSS scope by identifying systems connecting to and from theCDE.Good PracticeAll connections to and from the CDE should beidentified, including systems providing security, management, or maintenance services to CDE system components. Entities should consider including the following in their network diagrams: All locations, including retail locations, data centers, corporate locations, cloud providers, etc. Clear labeling of all network segments. All security controls providing segmentation, including unique identifiers for each control (for example, name of control, make, model, and version). All in -scope system components, includingNSCs, web app firewalls, anti-malwaresolutions, change management solutions, IDS IPS, log aggregation systems, payment terminals, payment applications , HSMs, etc.(continued on next page) 1.2.3 An accurate network diagram(s) is maintainedthat shows all connections between the CDE and other networks, including any wireless networks.1.2.3.a Examine diagram(s) and networkconfigurations to verify that an accurate network diagram(s) exists in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveA representation of the boundaries between the CDE, all trusted networks, and all untrusted networks, is maintained and available.1.2.3.b Examine documentation and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that the network diagram(s) is accurate and updated when there are changes to the environment.Applicability NotesA current network diagram(s) or other technical or topological solution that identifies networkconnections and devices can be used to meet thisrequirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.2.3 (continued) Clear labeling of any out -of-scope areas onthe diagram via a shaded box or othermechanism. Date of last update, and names of people that made and approved the updates. A legend or key to explain the diagram.Diagrams should be updated by authorizedpersonnel to ensure diagrams continue to providean accurate description of the network.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn up-to -date, readily available data- flow diagramhelps an organization understand and keep track of the scope of its environment by showing how account data flows across networks and between individual systems and devices.Maintaining an up-to -date data -flow diagram(s)prevents account data from being overlooked and unknowingly left unsecured.Good PracticeThe data-flow diagram should include all connection points where account data is received into and sent out of the network, including connections to open, public networks, application processing flows, storage, transmissions between systems and networks, and file backups.(continued on next page) 1.2.4 An accurate data-flow diagram(s) ismaintained that meets the following: Shows all account data flows across systemsand networks. Updated as needed upon changes to the environment. 1.2.4.a Examine data-flow diagram(s) andinterview personnel to verify the diagram(s) show all account data flows in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.1.2.4.b Examine documentation and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that the data-flowdiagram(s) is accurate and updated when there arechanges to the environment. Customized Approach ObjectiveA representation of all transmissions of accountdata between system components and acrossnetwork segments is maintained and available.Applicability NotesA data-flow diagram(s) or other technical or topological solution that identifies flows of account data across systems and networks can be used tomeet this requirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.2.4 (continued) The data-flow diagram is meant to be in additionto the network diagram and should reconcile with and augment the network diagram. As a best practice, entities can consider including the following in their data- flow diagrams: All processing flows of account data, including authorization, capture, settlement,chargeback, and refunds. All distinct acceptance channels, includingcard-present, card- not-present, and e-commerce. All types of data receipt or transmission, including any involving hard copy paper media. The flow of account data from the point where it enters the environment, to its final disposition. Where account data is transmitted and processed, where it is stored, and whether storage is short term or long term. The source of all account data received (for example, customers, third party, etc.), and anyentities with which account data is shared. Date of last update, and names of people thatmade and approved the updates.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCompromises often happen due to unused orinsecure services (for example, telnet and FTP), protocols, and ports, since these can lead to unnecessary points of access being opened into the CDE. Additionally, services, protocols, and ports that are enabled but not in use are oftenoverlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. Byidentifying the services, protocols, and ports necessary for business, entities can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed.Good PracticeThe security risk associated with each service,protocol, and port allowed should be understood.Approvals should be granted by personnel independent of those managing the configuration. Approving personnel should possess knowledge and accountability appropriate for making approval decisions. 1.2.5 All services, protocols, and ports allowed areidentified, approved, and have a defined business need. 1.2.5.a Examine documentation to verify that a listexists of all allowed services, protocols, and ports, including business justification and approval for each.1.2.5.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs toverify that only approved services, protocols, and ports are in use.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized network traffic (services, protocols, or packets destined for specific ports) cannot enter orleave the network.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCompromises take advantage of insecurenetwork configurations.Good PracticeIf insecure services, protocols, or ports are necessary for business, the risk posed by these services, protocols, and ports should be clearlyunderstood and accepted by the organization, theuse of the service, protocol, or port should be justified, and the security features that mitigate the risk of using these services, protocols, andports should be defined and implemented by the entity.Further InformationFor guidance on services, protocols, or ports considered to be insecure, refer to industry standards and guidance (for example, from NIST, ENISA, OWASP). 1.2.6 Security features are defined andimplemented for all services, protocols, and ports that are in use and considered to be insecure, such that the risk is mitigated. 1.2.6.a Examine documentation that identifies allinsecure services, protocols, and ports in use to verify that for each, security features are defined to mitigate the risk.1.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs toverify that the defined security features are implemented for each identified insecure service, protocol, and port.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe specific risks associated with the use of insecure services, protocols, and ports are understood, assessed, and appropriately mitigated.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSuch a review gives the organization anopportunity to clean up any unneeded, outdated, or incorrect rules and configurations which could be utilized by an unauthorized person. Furthermore, it ensures that all rules and configurations allow only authorized services,protocols, and ports that match the documentedbusiness j ustifications.Good PracticeThis review, which can be implemented using manual, automated, or system -based methods, isintended to confirm that the settings that manage traffic rules, what is allowed in and out of thenetwork, match the approved configurations.The review should provide confirmation that allpermitted access has a justified business reason. Any discrepancies or uncertainties about a rule or configuration should be escalated for resolution.While this requirement specifies that this review occur at least once every six months, organizations with a high volume of changes totheir network configurations may wish to considerperforming reviews more frequently to ensure that the configurations continue to meet the needs of the business. 1.2.7 Configurations of NSCs are reviewed at leastonce every six months to confirm they are relevant and effective. 1.2.7.a Examine documentation to verifyprocedures are defined for reviewing configurations of NSCs at least once every six months.1.2.7.b Examine documentation of reviews ofconfigurations for NSCs and interview responsible personnel to verify that reviews occur at least once every six months.1.2.7.c Examine configurations for NSCs to verifythat configurations identified as no longer being supported by a business justification are removed or updated.Customized Approach ObjectiveNSC configurations that allow or restrict access to trusted networks are verified periodically to ensurethat only authorized connections with a current business justification are permitted.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTo prevent unauthorized configurations frombeing applied to the network, stored files with configurations for network controls need to be kept up to date and secured against unauthorized changes.Keeping configuration information current andsecure ensures that the correct settings for NSCsare applied whenever the configuration is run.ExamplesIf the secure configuration for a router is stored in non-volatile memory, when that router is restarted or rebooted, these controls should ensure that its secure configuration is reinstated. 1.2.8 Configuration files for NSCs are: Secured from unauthorized access. Kept consistent with active network configurations. 1.2.8 Examine configuration files for NSCs to verifythey are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveNSCs cannot be defined or modified using untrusted configuration objects (including files).Applicability NotesAny file or setting used to configure or synchronizeNSCs is considered to be a configuration file. Thisincludes files, automated and system -basedcontrols, scripts, settings, infrastructure as code, orother parameters that are backed up, archived, or stored remotely.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThis requirement aims to prevent maliciousindividuals from accessing the entity's network via unauthorized IP addresses or from usingservices, protocols, or ports in an unauthorizedmanner.Good PracticeAll traffic inbound to the CDE, regardless of where it originates, should be evaluated to ensure it follows established, authorized rules. Connections should be inspected to ensure traffic is restrictedto only authorized communications -for example,by res tricting source destination addresses andports, and blocking of content.ExamplesImplementing a rule that denies all inbound andoutbound traffic that is not specifically needed-for example, by using an explicit deny all or implicit deny after allow statement -helps toprevent inadvertent holes that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic. 1.3.1 Inbound traffic to the CDE is restricted asfollows: To only traffic that is necessary. All other traffic is specifically denied. 1.3.1.a Examine configuration standards for NSCsto verify that they define restricting inbound traffic to the CDE is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.1.3.1.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verifythat inbound traffic to the CDE is restricted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized traffic cannot enter the CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThis requirement aims to prevent maliciousindividuals and compromised system componentswithin the entity's network from communicating with an untrusted external host.Good PracticeAll traffic outbound from the CDE, regardless ofthe destination, should be evaluated to ensure itfollows established, authorized rules. Connections should be inspected to restrict traffic to onlyauthorized communications -for example, byrestricting source destination addresses and ports, and blocking of content.ExamplesImplementing a rule that denies all inbound and outbound traffic that is not specifically needed-for example, by using an explicit deny all or implicit deny after allow statement -helps toprevent inadvertent holes that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic. 1.3.2 Outbound traffic from the CDE is restricted asfollows: To only traffic that is necessary. All other traffic is specifically denied. 1.3.2.a Examine configuration standards for NSCsto verify that they define restricting outbound traffic from the CDE in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.1.3.2.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verifythat outbound traffic from the CDE is restricted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized traffic cannot leave the CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe known (or unknown) implementation andexploitation of wireless technology within a network is a common path for malicious individuals to gain access to the network and account data . If a wireless device or network isinstalled without the entity's knowledge, amalicious individual could easily and invisiblyenter the network. If NSCs do not restrict access from wireless networks into the CDE, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network can easily connect to the CDE and compromise account information. 1.3.3 NSCs are installed between all wirelessnetworks and the CDE, regardless of whether the wireless network is a CDE, such that: All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the CDE is denied by default. Only wireless traffic with an authorized businesspurpose is allowed into the CDE. 1.3.3 Examine configuration settings and networkdiagrams to verify that NSCs are implementedbetween all wireless networks and the CDE, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized traffic cannot traverse network boundaries between any wireless networks and wired environments in the CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeImplementing NSCs at every connection cominginto and out of trusted networks allows the entity to monitor and control access and minimizes thechances of a malicious individual obtaining access to the internal network via an unprotected connection.ExamplesAn entity could implement a DMZ, which is a part of the network that manages connections between an untrusted network (for examples ofuntrusted networks refer to the Requirement 1Overview) and services that an organization needs to have available to the public, such as a web server. Please note that if an entity's DMZ processes or transmits account data (for example,e-commerce website), it is also considered a CDE. 1.4.1 NSCs are implemented between trusted anduntrusted networks. 1.4.1.a Examine configuration standards andnetwork diagrams to verify that NSCs are defined between trusted and untrusted networks.1.4.1.b Examine network configurations to verifythat NSCs are in place between trusted and untrusted networks, in accordance with the documented configuration standards and network diagrams.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized traffic cannot traverse network boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEnsuring that public access to a systemcomponent is specifically authorized reduces the risk of system components being unnecessarilyexposed to untrusted networks.Good PracticeSystem components that provide publiclyaccessible services, such as email, web, andDNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats originating from untrusted networks.Ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs from more sensitive internal systems, which helpsprotect the rest of the network in the event theseexternally ac cessible systems are compromised.This functionality is intended to prevent malicious actors from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner.Where this functionality is provided as a built -infeature of an NSC, the entity should ensure thatits configurations do not result in the functionalitybeing disabled or bypassed.DefinitionsMaintaining the state (or status) for each connection into a network means the NSC knows whether an apparent response to a previous connection is a valid, authorizedresponse (since the NSC retains eachconnection's status) or whether it is malicious traffic trying to fool the NSC into allowing theconnection. 1.4.2 Inbound traffic from untrusted networks totrusted networks is restricted to: Communications with system components that are authorized to provide publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports. Stateful responses to communications initiatedby system components in a trusted network. All other traffic is denied. 1.4.2 Examine vendor documentation andconfigurations of NSCs to verify that inbound trafficfrom untrusted networks to trusted networks is restricted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveOnly traffic that is authorized or that is a response toa system component in the trusted network canenter a trusted network from an untrusted network.Applicability NotesThe intent of this requirement is to addresscommunication sessions between trusted anduntrusted networks, rather than the specifics ofprotocols.This requirement does not limit the use of UDP or other connectionless network protocols if state is maintained by the NSC.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFiltering packets coming into the trusted networkhelps to, among other things, ensure packets are not spoofed to appear as if they are coming from an organization's own internal network. For example, anti -spoofing measures prevent internaladdresses originating from the Internet frompassing into the DMZ.Good PracticeProducts usually come with anti-spoofing set as adefault and may not be configurable. Entities should consult the vendor's documentation for more information.ExamplesNormally, a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet originated.Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address to fool the target system into believing the packet is from a trusted source. 1.4.3 Anti-spoofing measures are implemented todetect and block forged source IP addresses fromentering the trusted network. 1.4.3 Examine vendor documentation andconfigurations for NSCs to verify that anti -spoofingmeasures are implemented to detect and block forged source IP addresses from entering the trusted network.Customized Approach ObjectivePackets with forged IP source addresses cannot enter a trusted network.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCardholder data that is directly accessible from anuntrusted network, for example, because it isstored on a system within the DMZ or in a clouddatabase service, is easier for an external attacker to access because there are fewer defensive layers to penetrate. Using NSCs toensure that system components that storecardholder data (such as a database or a file) can only be directly accessed from trusted networks can prevent unauthorized network traffic fromreaching the system component. 1.4.4 System components that store cardholderdata are not directly accessible from untrustednetworks. 1.4.4.a Examine the data-flow diagram andnetwork diagram to verify that it is documented that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from the untrusted networks.1.4.4.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verifythat controls are implemented such that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.Customized Approach ObjectiveStored cardholder data cannot be accessed fromuntrusted networks.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to storageof account data in volatile memory but does applywhere memory is being treated as persistentstorage (for example, RAM disk). Account data canonly be stored in volatile memory during the time necessary to support the associated business process (for example, until comp letion of the relatedpayment card transaction).Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRestricting the disclosure of internal, private, andlocal IP addresses is useful to prevent a hacker from obtaining knowledge of these IP addresses and using that information to access the network.Good PracticeMethods used to meet the intent of thisrequirement may vary, depending on the specificnetworking technology being used. For example, the controls used to meet this requirement may be different for IPv4 networks than for IPv6 networks.ExamplesMethods to obscure IP addressing may include,but are not limited to: IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT). Placing system components behind proxyservers NSCs. Removal or filtering of route advertisements for internal networks that use registered addressing. Internal use of RFC 1918 (IPv4) or use IPv6privacy extension (RFC 4941) when initiatingoutgoing sessions to the internet. 1.4.5 The disclosure of internal IP addresses androuting information is limited to only authorized parties. 1.4.5.a Examine configurations of NSCs to verifythat the disclosure of internal IP addresses and routing information is limited to only authorized parties.1.4.5.b Interview personnel and examinedocumentation to verify that controls are implemented such that any disclosure of internal IP addresses and routing information is limited to only authorized parties.Customized Approach ObjectiveInternal network information is protected fromunauthorized disclosure.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeComputing devices that are allowed to connect tothe Internet from outside the corporate environment -for example, desktops, laptops,tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing devices used by employees -are more vulnerableto Internet -based threats.Use of security controls such as host -basedcontrols (for example, personal firewall software or end- point protection solutions), network -basedsecurity controls (for example, firewalls, network -based heuristics inspection, and malware simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices from Internet -based attacks, which could use thedevice to gain access to the organization's systems and data when the device reconnects to the network.(continued on next page) 1.5.1 Security controls are implemented on anycomputing devices, including company - andemployee-owned devices, that connect to bothuntrusted networks (including the Internet) and theCDE as follows: Specific configuration settings are defined toprevent threats being introduced into the entity's network. Security controls are actively running. Security controls are not alterable by users of the computing devices unless specificallydocumented and authorized by management ona case -by-case basis for a limited period. 1.5.1.a Examine policies and configurationstandards and interview personnel to verify security controls for computing devices that connect to both untrusted networks, and the CDE,are implemented in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.1.5.1.b Examine configuration settings oncomputing devices that connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE to verify settings are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveDevices that connect to untrusted environments andalso connect to the CDE cannot introduce threats tothe entity's CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeThe specific configuration settings are determinedby the entity and should be consistent with its network security policies and procedures.Where there is a legitimate need to temporarilydisable security controls on a company -owned oremployee-owned device that connects to both anuntrusted network and the CDE -for example, tosupport a specific maintenance activity orinvestigation of a technical problem -the reasonfor taking such action is understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators' owndevices, is performed by authorized personnel.It is recognized that administrators have privilegesthat may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.ExamplesPractices include forbidding split -tunneling ofVPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned mobile devices and requiring that such devices boot up into a VPN. These security controls may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by -casebasis. If these security controls need to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may alsoneed to be implemented for the period during whichthese security controls are not active.This requirement applies to employee -owned andcompany -owned computing devices. Systems thatcannot be managed by corporate policy introduce weaknesses and provide opportunities that malicious individuals may exploit.Requirement 2: Apply Secure Configurations to All System ComponentsSections2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.OverviewMalicious individuals, both external and internal to an entity, often use default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromisesystems. These passwords and settings are well known and are easily determined via public information.Applying secure configurations to system components reduces the means available to an attacker to compromise the system. Changing defaultpasswords, removing unnecessary software, functions, and accounts , and disabling or removing unnecessary services all help to reduce thepotential attack surface.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 2.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies andprocedures specified throughout Requirement 2.While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 2, it is equally important to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycleDefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's securityobjectives and principles.Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 2.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 2 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 2.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies andoperational procedures identified in Requirement 2are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 2 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles andresponsibilities .ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includeswho is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 2.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 2 are documented, assigned, and understood. 2.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 2 are documented and assigned.2.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 2 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 2 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThere are known weaknesses with manyoperating systems, databases, network devices,software, applications , container images, andother devices used by an entity or within anentity's environment. There are also known ways to configure these system components to fix security vulnerabilities. Fixing security vulnerabilities reduces the opportunities available to an attacker.By developing standards, entities ensure their system components will be configured consistently and securely and will address theprotection of devices for which full hardening may be more difficult.Good PracticeKeeping up to date with current industry guidance will help the entity maintain secure configurations.The specific controls to be applied to a system will vary and should be appropriate for the type and function of the system.Numerous security organizations have established system -hardening guidelines andrecommendations, which advise how to correct common, known weaknesses.Further InformationSources for guidance on configuration standards include but are not limited to: Center for Internet Security (CIS), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), CloudSecurity Alliance, and product vendors. 2.2.1 Configuration standards are developed,implemented, and maintained to: Cover all system components. Address all known security vulnerabilities. Be consistent with industry -accepted systemhardening standards or vendor hardening recommendations. Be updated as new vulnerability issues are identified, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1. Be applied when new systems are configuredand verified as in place before or immediatelyafter a system component is connected to a production environment. 2.2.1.a Examine system configuration standardsto verify they define processes that include allelements specified in this requirement.2.2.1.b Examine policies and procedures andinterview personnel to verify that systemconfiguration standards are updated as newvulnerability issues are identified, as defined inRequirement 6.3.1.2.2.1.c Examine configuration settings andinterview personnel to verify that systemconfiguration standards are applied when newsystems are configured and verified as being in place before or immediately after a system component is connected to a production environment.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll system components are configured securely and consistently and in accordance with industry -accepted hardening standards or vendor recommendations.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMalicious individuals often use vendor defaultaccount names and passwords to compromise operating systems, applications , and the systemson which they are installed. Because thesedefault settings are often published and are wellknown, changing these settings will make systems less vulnerable to attack.Good PracticeAll vendor default accounts should be identified, and their purpose and use understood. It is important to establish controls for application andsystem accounts, including those used to deployand maintain cloud services so that they do notuse default passwords and are not usable by unauthorized individuals.Where a default account is not intended to be used, changing the default password to a unique password that meets PCI DSS Requirement 8.3.6, removing any access to the defaultaccount, and then disabling the account, willprevent a malicious individual from re -enablingthe account and gaining access with the default password.Using an isolated staging network to install and configure new systems is recommended and can also be used to confirm that default credentials have not been introduced into productionenvironments.ExamplesDefaults to be considered include user IDs,passwords, and other authentication credentialscommonly used by vendors in their products. 2.2.2 Vendor default accounts are managed asfollows: If the vendor default account(s) will be used, thedefault password is changed per Requirement8.3.6. If the vendor default account(s) will not be used, the account is removed or disabled. 2.2.2.a Examine system configuration standards toverify they include managing vendor default accounts in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.2.2.2.b Examine vendor documentation andobserve a system administrator logging on using vendor default accounts to verify accounts are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.2.2.2.c Examine configuration files and interviewpersonnel to verify that all vendor default accounts that will not be used are removed or disabled.Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be accessed using default passwords.Applicability NotesThis applies to ALL vendor default accounts andpasswords, including, but not limited to , those usedby operating systems, software that providessecurity services, application and system accounts, point -of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications,and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defaults.This requirement also applies where a system component is not installed within an entity'senvironment, for example, software and applicationsthat are part of the CDE and are accessed via a cloud subscription service.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSystems containing a combination of services,protocols, and daemons for their primary function will have a security profile appropriate to allow that function to operate effectively. For example,systems that need to be directly connected to theInternet would have a particular profile, like aDNS server, web server, or an e-commerceserver. Conversely, other system components may operate a primary function comprising a different set of services, protocols , and daemonsthat perform functions that an entity does not wantexposed to the Internet. This requirement aims toensure that different functions do not impact thesecurity profiles of other services in a way which may cause them to operate at a higher or lower security level.Good PracticeIdeally, each function should be placed on different system components. This can beachieved by implementing only one primaryfunction on each system component. Another option is to isolate primary functions on the same system component that have different securitylevels, for example, isolating web servers (whichneed to be directly connected to the Internet) from application and database servers.(continued on next page) 2.2.3 Primary functions requiring different securitylevels are managed as follows: Only one primary function exists on a system component,OR Primary functions with differing security levels that exist on the same system component are isolated from each other,OR Primary functions with differing security levels on the same system component are all secured tothe level required by the function with thehighest security need. 2.2.3.a Examine system configuration standards toverify they include managing primary functionsrequiring different security levels as specified in this requirement.2.2.3.b Examine system configurations to verifythat primary functions requiring different security levels are managed per one of the ways specified in this requirement.2.2.3.c Where virtualization technologies are used,examine the system configurations to verify thatsystem functions requiring different security levels are managed in one of the following ways: Functions with differing security needs do not co-exist on the same system component. Functions with differing security needs that exist on the same system component are isolated from each other. Functions with differing security needs on the same system component are all secured to the level required by the function with the highest security need. Customized Approach ObjectivePrimary functions with lower security needs cannotaffect the security of primary functions with higher security needs on the same system component.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance2.2.3 (continued) If a system component contains primary functionsthat need different security levels, a third option is to implement additional controls to ensure that the resultant security level of the primary function(s) with higher security needs is not reduced by thepresence of the lower security primary functions. Additionally, the functions with a lower security level should be isolated and or secured to ensure they cannot access or affect the resources of another system function, and do not introduce security weaknesses to other functions on the same server.Functions of differing security levels may beisolated by either physical or logical controls. Forexample, a database system should not also be hosting web services unless using controls like virtualization technologies to isolate and contain the function s into separate sub -systems. Anotherexample is using virtual instances or providing dedicated memory access by system function.Where virtualization technologies are used, the security levels should be identified and managed for each virtual component. Examples of considerations for virtualized environments include: The function of each application , container, orvirtual server instance. How virtual machines (VMs) or containers arestored and secured.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUnnecessary services and functions can provideadditional opportunities for malicious individuals to gain access to a system. By removing or disabling all unnecessary services, protocols,daemons, and functions, organizations can focuson securing the functions that are required and reduce the risk that unknown or unnecessary functions will be exploited.Good PracticeThere are many protocols that could be enabled by default that are commonly used by malicious individuals to compromise a network. Disabling orremoving all services, functions, and protocolsthat are not used minimizes the potential attack surface -for example, by removing or disablingan unused FTP or web server.ExamplesUnnecessary functionality may include, but is notlimited to scripts, drivers, features, subsystems,file systems, interfaces (USB and Bluetooth), andunnecessary web servers. 2.2.4 Only necessary services, protocols, daemons,and functions are enabled, and all unnecessary functionality is removed or disabled. 2.2.4.a Examine system configuration standards toverify necessary services, protocols, daemons , andfunctions are identified and documented.2.2.4.b Examine system configurations to verify thefollowing: All unnecessary functionality is removed or disabled. Only required functionality, as documented inthe configuration standards, is enabled. Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be compromised by exploiting unnecessary functionality present in thesystem component.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEnsuring that all insecure services, protocols, anddaemons are adequately secured with appropriate security features makes it more difficult for malicious individuals to exploitcommon points of compromise within a network.Good PracticeEnabling security features before new systemcomponents are deployed will prevent insecure configurations from being introduced into the environment. Some vendor solutions may provide additional security functions to assist with securing an insecure proces s.Further InformationFor guidance on services, protocols, or daemons considered to be insecure, refer to industry standards and guidance (for example, as published by NIST, ENISA, and OWASP). 2.2.5 If any insecure services, protocols, ordaemons are present: Business justification is documented. Additional security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of usinginsecure services, protocols, or daemons. 2.2.5.a If any insecure services, protocols, ordaemons are present, examine systemconfiguration standards and interview personnel to verify they are managed and implemented in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.2.2.5.b If any insecure services, protocols, ordaemons, are present, examine configurationsettings to verify that additional security featuresare implemented to reduce the risk of usinginsecure services, daemons, and protocols. Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be compromised by exploiting insecure services, protocols, or daemons.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCorrectly configuring security parametersprovided in system components takes advantageof the capabilities of the system component to defeat malicious attacks.Good PracticeSystem configuration standards and related processes should specifically address security settings and parameters that have known security implications for each type of system in use.For systems to be configured securely, personnel responsible for configuration and or administering systems should be knowledgeable in the specificsecurity parameters and settings that apply to thesystem. Considerations should also include secure setting s for parameters used to accesscloud portals.Further InformationRefer to vendor documentation and industry references noted in Requirement 2.2.1 forinformation about applicable security parametersfor each type of system. 2.2.6 System security parameters are configured toprevent misuse. 2.2.6.a Examine system configuration standards toverify they include configuring system security parameters to prevent misuse.2.2.6.b Interview system administrators and orsecurity managers to verify they have knowledge of common security parameter settings for system components.2.2.6.c Examine system configurations to verifythat common security parameters are setappropriately and in accordance with the systemconfiguration standards. Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be compromised because of incorrect security parameter configuration.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf non -console (including remote) administrationdoes not use encrypted communications,administrative authorization factors (such as IDsand passwords) can be revealed to aneavesdropper. A malicious individual could usethis information to access the network, become administrator, and steal data.Good PracticeWhichever security protocol is used, it should be configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection-for example, by using only trustedcertificates, supporting only strong encryption,and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure protocols or methods.ExamplesCleartext protocols (such as HTTP, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information.Non-console access may be facilitated bytechnologies that provide alternative access tosystems, in cluding but not limited to, out -of-band(OOB), lights -out management (LOM) , IntelligentPlatform Management Interface (IPMI), and keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switches with remote capabilities. These an d other non- consoleaccess technologies and methods mu st besecured with strong cryptography.Further InformationRefer to industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800 -52 and SP 800-57 . 2.2.7 All non -console administrative access isencrypted using strong cryptography. 2.2.7.a Examine system configuration standards toverify they include encrypting all non-console administrative access using strong cryptography.2.2.7.b Observe an administrator log on to systemcomponents and examine system configurations to verify that non-console administrative access is managed in accordance with this requirement.2.2.7.c Examine settings for system componentsand authentication services to verify that insecure remote login services are not available for non-console administrative access.2.2.7.d Examine vendor documentation andinterview personnel to verify that strong cryptography for the technology in use is implemented according to industry best practices and or vendor recommendations.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext administrative authorization factors cannotbe read or intercepted from any network transmissions.Applicability NotesThis includes administrative access via browser -based interfaces and application programming interfaces (API s).Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf wireless networks are not implemented withsufficient security configurations (includingchanging default settings), wireless sniffers caneavesdrop on the traffic, easily capture data and passwords, and easily enter and attack the network.Good PracticeWireless passwords should be constructed so that they are resistant to offline brute forceattacks. 2.3.1 For wireless environments connected to theCDE or transmitting account data , all wirelessvendor defaults are changed at installation or areconfirmed to be secure, including but not limited to: Default wireless encryption keys . Passwords on wireless access points . SNMP defaults . Any other security -related wireless vendordefaults . 2.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures andinterview responsible personnel to verify thatprocesses are defined for wireless vendor defaultsto either change them upon installation or to confirm them to be secure in accordance with all elements of this requirement.2.3.1.b Examine vendor documentation andobserve a system administrator logging into wireless devices to verify: SNMP defaults are not used. Default passwords passphrases on wireless access points are not used.2.3.1.c Examine vendor documentation andwireless configuration settings to verify other security -related wireless vendor defaults werechanged, if applicable. Customized Approach ObjectiveWireless networks cannot be accessed usingvendor default passwords or default configurations.Applicability NotesThis includes, but is not limited to, default wirelessencryption keys, passwords on wireless access points, SNMP defaults, and any other security -related wireless vendor defaults.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeChanging wireless encryption keys wheneversomeone with knowledge of the key leaves the organization or moves to a role that no longer requires knowledge of the key, helps keepknowledge of keys limited to only those with abusiness need to know.Also, changing wireless encryption keyswhenever a key is suspected or known to be comprised makes a wireless network more resistant to compromise.Good PracticeThis goal can be accomplished in multiple ways,including periodic changes of keys, changing keysvia a defined joiners -movers -leavers (JML)process, implementing additional technical controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys.In addition, any keys that are known to be, orsuspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity's incidentresponse plan at Requirement 12.10.1. 2.3.2 For wireless environments connected to theCDE or transmitting account data , wirelessencryption keys are changed as follows: Whenever personnel with knowledge of the keyleave the company or the role for which theknowledge was necessary. Whenever a key is suspected of or known to becompromised. 2.3.2 Interview responsible personnel and examinekey-management documentation to verify thatwireless encryption keys are changed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveKnowledge of wireless encryption keys cannot allowunauthorized access to wireless networks.Protect Account DataRequirement 3: Protect Stored Account DataSections3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy PAN are restricted.3.5 Primary account number ( PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the keylifecycle are defined and implemented.OverviewProtection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of account data protection. I f an intrudercircumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cry ptographic keysand is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk -mitigationopportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary , truncating cardholder data if fullPAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end- user messaging technologies such as e- mail and instant messaging.If account data is present in non- persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of PAN is not required. However, propercontrols must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non- persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once thebusiness purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete . In the case that data storage becomes persistent , all applicable PCIDSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data.Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of strong cryptography and other PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 3.1.1 is about effectively managing andmaintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 3. While it isimportant to define the specific policies or procedurescalled out in Requirement 3, it is equally important toensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies,and business objectives. For this reason, considerupdating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycl e.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desiredresult in a consistent manner and in accordance withpolicy objectives. 3.1.1 All security policies and operational proceduresthat are identified in Requirement 3 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 3.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies andoperational procedures identified in Requirement 3are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 3 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned,personnel may not be aware of their day -to-dayresponsibilities , and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separatedocuments.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities,entities can consider having personnel acknowledgetheir acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is aresponsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 3.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing activitiesin Requirement 3 are documented, assigned, and understood. 3.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities performing activities in Requirement 3 are documented and assigned.3.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 3 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 3 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA formal data retention policy identifies what dataneeds to be retained, for how long, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted assoon as it is no longer needed. The only account datathat may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of thissensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained forthe defined amount of time.Good PracticeWhen identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. Storage locations that are often overlooked include backup andarchive systems, removable data storage devices,paper -based media, and audio recordings.To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained. Implementing an automated process to ensure data isautomatically and securely deleted upon its definedretention limit can help ensure that account data is not retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.(continued on next page) 3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum throughimplementation of data retention and disposal policies,procedures, and processes that include at least thefollowing: Coverage for all locations of stored account data. Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. This bulletis a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. Limiting data storage amount and retention time tothat which is required for legal or regulatory, and orbusiness requirements. Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification. Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per theretention policy. A process for verifying, at least once every threemonths, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable. 3.2.1.a Examine the data retention and disposalpolicies, procedures, and processes and interviewpersonnel to verify processes are defined toinclude all elements specified in this requirement.3.2.1.b Examine files and system records onsystem components where account data is stored to verify that the data storage amount and retentiontime does not exceed the requirements defined inthe data retention policy.3.2.1.c Observe the mechanisms used to renderaccount data unrecoverable to verify data cannotbe recovered.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccount data is retained only where necessary and forthe least amount of time needed and is securely deletedor rendered unrecoverable when no longer needed.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds theretention period include secure deletion to complete remov al of the data or rendering it unrecoverable andunable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securelyeliminating stored data that has exceeded its specifiedretention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may beautomated, manual, or a combination of both.The deletion function in most operating systems is notsecure deletion as it allows deleted data to berecovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletionfunction or application must be used to make dataunrecoverable.Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!ExamplesAn automated, programmatic procedure could be run to locate and remove data, or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to monitor the process to ensure it is completed successfully, and that the resultsare recorded and validated as being complete.Implementing secure deletion methods ensures that thedata cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.Further InformationSee NIST SP 800 -88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for MediaSanitization. Where account data is stored by a TPSP (for example,in a cloud environment), entities are responsible for working with their service providers to understand how the TPSP meets this requirement for the entity. Considerations include ensuring that all geogr aphicinstances of a data element are securely deleted.The bullet above (for coverage of SAD stored prior tocompletion of authorization) is a best practice until 31March 2025, after which it will be required as part ofRequirement 3.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization .Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSAD is very valuable to malicious individuals as itallows them to generate counterfeit payment cards andcreate fraudulent transactions. Therefore, the storageof SAD upon completion of the authorization process isprohibited.Good PracticeIt may be acceptable for an entity to store SAD in non-persistent memory for a short time after authorization is complete, if following conditions are met: There is a legitimate business need to accessSAD in memory after authorization is complete. SAD is only ever stored in non -persistent memory(for example, RAM, volatile memory). Controls are in place to ensure that memory maintains a non- persistent state. SAD is removed as soon as the business purposeis complete.It is not permissible to store SAD in persistent memory.DefinitionsThe authorization process completes when a merchantreceives a transaction response (for example, anapproval or decline).Refer to Appendix G for the definition of authorization. 3.3.1 SAD is not stored after authorization, even ifencrypted. All sensitive authentication data received isrendered unrecoverable upon completion of theauthorization process. 3.3.1.a If SAD is received, examine documentedpolicies, procedures, and system configurations to verify the data is not stored after authorization.3.3.1.b If SAD is received, examine thedocumented procedures and observe the securedata deletion processes to verify the data is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesIssuers and companies that support issuing services ,where there is a legitimate and documented businessneed to store SAD, are not required to meet thisrequirement . A legitimate business need is one that isnecessary for the performance of the function being provided by or for the issuer. Refer to Requirement 3.3.3for additional requirements specifically for these entities .Sensitive authentication data includes the data cited in Requirements 3.3.1.1 through 3.3.1.3.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf full contents of any track (from the magnetic stripe onthe back of a card if present, equivalent data contained on a chip, or elsewhere) is stored, malicious individuals who obtain that data can use it to reproduce payment cards and complete fraudulent transactions.DefinitionsFull track data is alternatively called full track, track, track 1, track 2, and magnetic -stripe data. Each trackcontains a number of data elements, and this requirement specifies only those that may be retained post-authorization.ExamplesData sources to review to ensure that the full contentsof any track are not retained upon completion of theauthorization process include, but are not limited to: Incoming transaction data . All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error) . History files . Trace files . Database schemas . Contents of databases , and on -premise and clouddata stores . Any existing memory crash dump files . 3.3.1.1 The full contents of any track are not stored uponcompletion of the authorization process. 3.3.1.1 Examine data sources to verify that the fullcontents of any track are not stored upon completion of the authorization process.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesIn the normal course of business, the following data elements from the track may need to be retained: Cardholder name . Primary account number (PAN) . Expiration date. Service code .To minimize risk, store securely only these data elements as needed for business.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf card verification code data is stolen, maliciousindividuals can execute fraudulent Internet and mail -order telephone-order (MO TO) transactions. Not storing this data reduces the probability of it being compromised.ExamplesIf card verification codes are stored on paper media prior to completion of authorization, a method of erasing or covering the codes should prevent them from being read after authorization is complete. Example methods of rendering the codes unreadable include removing the code with scissors and applying asuitably opaque and un-removable marker over thecode.Data sources to review to ensure that the cardverification code is not retained upon completion of the authorization process include, but are not limited to: Incoming transaction data . All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error) . History files . Trace files . Database schemas . Contents of databases , and on -premise and clouddata stores . Any existing memory crash dump files . 3.3.1.2 The card verification code is not stored uponcompletion of the authorization process. 3.3.1.2 Examine data sources, to verify that thecard verification code is not stored upon completion of the authorization process.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesThe card verification code is the three - or four -digitnumber printed on the front or back of a payment card used to verify card-not -present transactions.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePIN and PIN blocks should be known only to the cardowner or entity that issued the card. If this data is stolen, malicious individuals can execute fraudulentPIN-based transactions (for example, in-store purchases and ATM withdrawals). Not storing this data reduces the probability of it being compromised.ExamplesData sources to review to ensure that PIN and PIN blocks are not retained upon completion of the authorization process include, but are not limited to: Incoming transaction data . All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error) . History files . Trace files . Database schemas . Contents of databases , and on -premise and clouddata stores . Any existing memory crash dump files . 3.3.1.3 The personal identification number (PIN) and thePIN block are not stored upon completion of theauthorization process. 3.3.1.3 Examine data sources, to verify that PINsand PIN blocks are not stored upon completion of the authorization process.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesPIN blocks are encrypted during the natural course oftransaction processes, but even if an entity encrypts the PIN block again, it is still not allowed to be stored after the completion of the authorization process.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSAD can be used by malicious individuals to increasethe probability of successfully generating counterfeit payment cards and creating fraudulent transactions.Good PracticeEntities should consider encrypting SAD with a different cryptographic key than is used to encrypt PAN. Notethat this does not mean that PAN present in SAD (aspart of track data) would need to be separatelyencrypted. 3.3.2 SAD that is stored electronically prior to completionof authorization is encrypted using strong cryptography. 3.3.2 Examine data stores, system configurations,and or vendor documentation to verify that all SADthat is stored electronically prior to completion ofauthorization is encrypted using strong cryptography. Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes DefinitionsThe authorization process is completed when amerchant receives a transaction response (for example,an approval or decline) .Refer to Appendix G for the definition of authorization . Whether SAD is permitted to be stored prior to authorization is determined by the organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers ). Contact the se organizations forany additional criteria.This requirement applies to all storage of SAD, even if no PAN is present in the environment.Refer to Requirement 3.2.1 for an additional requirement that applies if SAD is stored prior to completion of authorization.Issuers and companies that support issuing services ,where there is a legitimate and documented businessneed to store SAD , are not required to meet thisrequirement . A legitimate business need is one that isnecessary for the performance of the function being provided by or for the issuer .Refer to Requirement 3.3.3 for requirements specifically for these entities .This requirement does not replace how PIN blocks are required to be managed, nor does it mean that aproperly encrypted PIN block needs to be encryptedagain.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSAD can be used by malicious individuals to increasethe probability of successfully generating counterfeit payment cards and creating fraudulent transactions .Good PracticeEntities should consider encrypting SAD with a different cryptographic key than is used to encrypt PAN. Notethat this does not mean that PAN present in SAD (aspart of track data) would need to be separately encrypted.3.3.3 Additional requirement for issuers andcompanies that support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data: Any storage of sensitiveauthentication data is : L imited to that which is needed for a legitimateissuing business need and is secured. Encrypted using strong cryptography. This bullet is abest practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. 3.3.3.a Additional testing procedure for issuersand companies that support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data:Examine documented policies and interview personnel to verify there is a documented businessjustification for the storage of sensitiveauthentication data.3.3.3.b Additional testing procedure for issuersand companies that support issuing servicesand store sensitive authentication data:Examine data stores and system configurations toverify that the sensitive authentication data is stored securely. Customized Approach ObjectiveSensitive authentication data is retained only as required to support issuing functions and is secured fromunauthorized access.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThis requirement applies only to issuers and companiesthat support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data.Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and controlsensitive authentication data as part of the issuingfunction. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services t o store sensitiveauthentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data.A legitimate issuing business need is one that isnecessary for the performance of the function being provided by or for the issuer.The bullet above (for encrypting stored SAD with strong cryptography) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.3.3 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy PAN are restricted.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe display of full PAN on computer screens, paymentcard receipts, paper reports, etc. can result in this data being obtained by unauthorized individuals and usedfraudulently. Ensuring that the full PAN is displayedonly for those with a legitimate business need minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN data.Good PracticeApplying access controls according to defined roles is one way to limit access to viewing full PAN to onlythose individuals with a defined business need.The masking approach should always display only thenumber of digits needed to perform a specific business function. For example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, PAN should be masked to only show the last four digits. As another example, if a function needs to view the bank identification number (BIN) for routing purposes,unmask only the BIN digits for that function.(continued on next page)3.4.1 PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and lastfour digits are the maximum number of digits to bedisplayed), such that only personnel with a legitimatebusiness need can see more than the BIN and last fourdigits of the PAN.(continued on next page) 3.4.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures for masking the display of PANs toverify: A list of roles that need access to more thanthe BIN and last four digits of the PAN (includes full PAN) is documented, together with a legitimate business need for each role to have such access. PAN is masked when displayed such that only personnel with a legitimate business need cansee more than the BIN and last four digits ofthe PAN. All roles not specifically authorized to see the full PAN must only see masked PANs.3.4.1.b Examine system configurations to verifythat full PAN is only displayed for roles with a documented business need, and that PAN is masked for all other requests.3.4.1.c Examine displays of PAN (for example, onscreen, on paper receipts) to verify that PANs are masked when displayed, and that only those with a legitimate business need are able to see more than the BIN and or last four digits of the PAN.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective DefinitionsMasking is not synonymous with truncation and theseterms cannot be used interchangeably. Masking refers to the concealment of certain digits during display or printing, even when the entire PAN is stored on a system. This is different from truncation, in which thetruncated digits are removed and cannot be retrievedwithin the system. Masked PAN could be unmasked,but there is no un-truncation without recreating the PAN from another source.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of masking andtruncation.Further InformationFor more information about masking and truncation,see PCI SSC's FAQs on these topics . PAN displays are restricted to the minimum number ofdigits necessary to meet a defined business need.Applicability NotesThis requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder data-for example, legal or payment brand requirements for point -of-sale (POS) receipts.This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., andis not to be confused with Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, ortransmitted.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRelocation of PAN to unauthorized storage devices is acommon way for this data to be obtained and used fraudulently.Methods to ensure that only those with explicit authorization and a legitimate business reason can copy or relocate PAN minimizes the risk ofunauthorized persons gaining access to PAN.Good PracticeCopying and relocation of PAN should only be done tostorage devices that are permissible and authorized for that individual.DefinitionsA virtual desktop is an example of a remote-accesstechnology. Such remote access technologies ofteninclude tools to disable copy and or relocation functionality.Storage devices include, but are not limited to, local hard drives, virtual drives, removable electronic media, network drives, and cloud storage.Further InformationVendor documentation for the remote-accesstechnology in use will provide information about thesystem settings needed to implement this requirement. 3.4.2 When using remote-access technologies, technicalcontrols prevent copy and or relocation of PAN for all personnel, except for those with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need. 3.4.2.a Examine documented policies andprocedures and documented evidence for technical controls that prevent copy and or relocation of PAN when using remote- access technologies onto localhard drives or removable electronic media to verifythe following: Technical controls prevent all personnel notspecifically authorized from copying and or relocating PAN. A list of personnel with permission to copy and or relocate PAN is maintained, together with the documented, explicit authorization and legitimate, defined business need. Customized Approach ObjectivePAN cannot be copied or relocated by unauthorized personnel using remote-access technologies.Applicability Notes 3.4.2.b Examine configurations for remote-accesstechnologies to verify that technical controls to prevent copy and or relocation of PAN for allpersonnel, unless explicitly authorized. Storing or relocating PAN onto local hard drives,removable electronic media, and other storage devicesbrings these devices into scope for PCI DSS.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. 3.4.2.c Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify that only personnel withdocumented, explicit authorization and alegitimate, defined business need have permission to copy and or relocate PAN when using remote-access technologies.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRendering stored PAN unreadable is a defense indepth control designed to protect the data if an unauthorized individual gains access to stored data bytaking advantage of a vulnerability or misconfigurationof an entity's primary access control.Good PracticeIt is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual toreconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed versions of a PAN.Controls that prevent the correlation of this data willhelp ensure that the original PAN remains unreadable. Implementing keyed cryptographic hashes with associated key management processes and procedures in accordance with Requirement 3.5.1.1 is a valid additional control to prevent correlation.Further InformationFor information about truncation formats and truncationin general, see PCI SSC's FAQs on the topic.Sources for information about index tokens include: PCI SSC's Tokenization Product SecurityGuidelines (https: www.pcisecuritystandards.org documents Tokenization Product Security Guidelines.pdf ) ANSI X9.119 -2-2017: Retail Financial Services -Requirements For Protection Of Sensitive Payment Card Data - Part 2: Implementing Post -AuthorizationTokenization Systems 3.5.1 PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is storedby using any of the following approaches: One-way hashes based on strong cryptography ofthe entire PAN. Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN).- If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment, additional controls are in place such that the differentversions cannot be correlated to reconstruct theoriginal PAN. Index tokens. Strong cryptography with associated key -management processes and procedures. 3.5.1.a Examine documentation about the systemused to render PAN unreadable, including thevendor, type of system process, and the encryptionalgorithms (if applicable) to verify that the PAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requ irement.3.5.1.b Examine data repositories and audit logs,including payment application logs, to verify thePAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requirement.3.5.1.c If hashed and truncated versions of thesame PAN are present in the environment, examine implemented controls to verify that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read from storage media.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non- primary storage (backup,audit logs, exception, or troubleshooting logs).This requirement does not preclude the use of temporary files containing cleartext PAN while encrypting anddecrypting PAN.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRendering stored PAN unreadable is a defense indepth control designed to protect the data if an unauthorized individual gains access to stored data by taking advantage of a vulnerability or misconfiguration of an entity's primary access control.A hashing function that incorporates a randomlygenerated secret key provides brute force attackresistance and secret authentication integrity.DefinitionsRefer to Appendix G for the definition of keyedcryptographic hash and for information about appropriate keyed cryptographic hashing algorithms and additional resources.ExamplesSystems which only have access to one hash value ata time and which store no other account data on thesame system as the hash, are not required to meetkey-management processes and procedures(Requirements 3.6 and 3.7). Examples of such systemsinclude transaction-originating devices that generate ahash of the PAN for use in a backend system, such aspay-at-gate transit turnstiles. However, in such animplementation , the backend system will have accessto more than one hash value at a time, and therefore isrequired to meet key-management processes andprocedur es at Requirements 3.6 and 3.7.3.5.1.1 Hashes used to render PAN unreadable (per thefirst bullet of Requirement 3.5.1) are keyed cryptographichashes of the entire PAN, with associated key -management processes and procedures in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. 3.5.1.1.a Examine documentation about thehashing method used to render PAN unreadable, including the vendor, type of system process, and the encryption algorithms (as applicable) to verify that the hashing method results in keyedcryptographic hashes of the entire PAN, withassociated key management processes andprocedures.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be determined from hashes of the PAN. 3.5.1.1.b Examine documentation about the keymanagement procedures and processesassociated with the keyed cryptographic hashes to verify keys are managed in accordance withRequirements 3.6 and 3.7.3.5.1.1.c Examine data repositories to verify thePAN is rendered unreadable.3.5.1.1.d Examine audit logs, including paymentapplication logs, to verify the PAN is renderedunreadable.Applicability NotesAll Applicability Notes for Requirement 3.5.1 also apply to this requirement.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance(continued )Key-management processes and procedures(Requirements 3.6 and 3.7) do not apply to systemcomponents used to generate individual keyed hashesof a PAN for comparison to another system if : The system components only have access to one hash value at a time (hash values are not stored onthe system)AND There is no other account data stored on the samesystem as the hashes.This requirement is considered a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. Thisrequirement will replace the bullet in Requirement 3.5.1 for one -way hashes once its effective date is reached.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDisk-level and partition- level encryption typicallyencrypts the entire disk or partition using the same key,with all data automatically decrypted when the system runs or when an authorized user requests it. For this reason, disk -level encryption is not a ppropriate toprotect stored PAN on computers, laptops, servers,storage arrays, or any other system that providestransparent decryption upon user authentication.Further InformationWhere available, following vendors' hardening and industry best practice guidelines can assist in securing PAN on these devices. 3.5.1.2 If disk -level or partition -level encryption (ratherthan file-, column -, or field -level database encryption) isused to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows: On removable electronic mediaOR If used for non -removable electronic media, PAN isalso rendered unreadable via another mechanism that meets Requirement 3.5.1. 3.5.1.2.a Examine encryption processes to verifythat, if disk -level or partition-level encryption isused to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows: On removable electronic media,OR If used for non -removable electronic media,examine encryption processes used to verify that PAN is also rendered unreadable via another method that meets Requirement 3.5.1.3.5.1.2.b Examine configurations and or vendordocumentation and observe encryption processes to verify the system is configured according to vendor documentation the result is that the disk or the partition is rendered unreadable.Customized Approach ObjectiveEncrypted PAN is only decrypted when there is alegitimate business need to access that PAN.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes(continued)This requirement applies to any encryption method thatprovides clear -text PAN automatically when a systemruns, even though an authorized user has notspecifically requested that data.While disk or partition encryption may still be present onthese types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanismused to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per Requirement 3.5.1-for example, through trunc ation or adata-level encryption mechanism. Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is appropriate only for removable electronic media storage devices.Media that is part of a data center architecture (forexample, hot -swappable drives, bulk tape- backups) isconsidered non-removable electronic media to which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.Disk or partition encryption implementations must also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key -managementrequirements.For issuers and companies that support issuing services: This requirement does not apply to PANs being accessed for real -time transaction processing. However,it does apply to PANs stored for other purposes.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDisk-level encryption typically encrypts the entire diskor partition using the same key, with all dataautomatically decrypted when the system runs or when an authorized user requests it. Many disk -encryptionsolutions intercept operating system read writ eoperations and perform the appropriate cryptographictransformations without any special action by the userother than supplying a password or passphrase at system start -up or at the beginning of a session. Thisprovides no protection from a malicious individual that has already managed to gain access to a valid user account.Good PracticeFull disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is best limited only to removable electronic media storage devices. 3.5.1.3 If disk -level or partition -level encryption is used(rather than file-, column -, or field -level databaseencryption) to render PAN unreadable, it is managed as follows: Logical access is managed separately and independently of native operating systemauthentication and access control mechanisms. Decryption keys are not associated with useraccounts . Authentication factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow access to unencrypted data are stored securely. 3.5.1.3.a If disk -level or partition-level encryption isused to render PAN unreadable, examine the system configuration and observe the authentication process to verify that logical access is implemented in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.3.5.1.3.b Examine files containing authenticationfactors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographickeys) and interview personnel to verify thatauthentication factors that allow access tounencrypted data are stored securely and are independent from the native operating system's authentication and access control methods.Customized Approach ObjectiveDisk encryption implementations are configured to require independent authentication and logical access controls for decryption.Applicability NotesDisk or partition encryption implementations must also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key -managementrequirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCryptographic keys must be strongly protected becausethose who obtain access will be able to decrypt data.Good PracticeHaving a centralized key management system based on industry standards is recommended for managing cryptographic keys.Further InformationThe entity's key management procedures will benefit through alignment with industry requirements, Sources for information on cryptographic key management lifecycles include: ISO 11568- 1 Banking - Key management (retail)- Part 1 : Principles (specifically Chapter 10 and thereferenced Parts 2 4) NIST SP 800 -57 Part 1 Revision 5-Recommendation for Key Management, Part 1:General. 3.6.1 Procedures are defined and implemented toprotect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse that include: Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary. Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting keys they protect. Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting keys. Keys are stored securely in the fewest possiblelocations and forms. 3.6.1 Examine documented key -managementpolicies and procedures to verify that processes toprotect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse aredefined to include all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveProcesses that protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse are defined and implemented.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to keys used to protectstored account data and to key-encrypting keysused to protect data-encrypting keys.The requirement to protect keys used to protect stored account data from disclosure and misuse applies to both data- encrypting keys and key -encrypting keys. Because one key -encrypting keymay grant access to many data-encrypting keys, the key-encrypting ke ys require strong protectionmeasures.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMaintaining current documentation of the cryptographicarchitecture enables an entity to understand the algorithms, protocols, and cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data, as well as the devices that generate, use, and protect the keys. This allows anentity to keep pace with evolving threats to itsarchitecture and plan for updates as the assurancelevel provided by different algorithms and key strengths changes. Maintaining such documentation also allows an entity to detect lost or missing keys or key -management devices and identify unauthorized additions to its cryptographic architecture.The use of the same cryptographic keys in bothproduction and test environments introduces a risk ofexposing the key if the test environment is not at thesame security level as the production environment.Good PracticeHaving an automated reporting mechanism can assist with maintenance of the cryptographic attributes. 3.6.1.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: A documented description of thecryptographic architecture is maintained that includes: Details of all algorithms, protocols, and keysused for the protection of stored account data,including key strength and expiry date. Preventing the use of the same cryptographic keys in production and test environments. Thisbullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. Description of the key usage for each key. Inventory of any hardware security modules(HSMs), key management systems (KMS), andother secure cryptographic devices (SCDs) used for key management, including type and location of devices, to support meeting Requirement12.3. 4. 3.6.1.1 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Interviewresponsible personnel and examine documentation to verify that a document exists to describe the cryptographic architecture that includes allelements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccurate details of the cryptographic architectureare maintained and available.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity beingassessed is a service provider.In cloud HSM implementations, responsibility for the cryptographic architecture according to this Requirement will be shared between the cloud provider and the cloud customer.The bullet above (for including, in the cryptographicarchitecture, that the use of the same cryptographickeys in production and test is prevented) is a bestpractice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.6.1.1 and mustbe fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeStoring cryptographic keys securely preventsunauthorized or unnecessary access that could result in the exposure of stored account data. Storing keys separately means they are stored such that if the location of one key is compromised, the second key is not also compromised.Good PracticeWhere data- encrypting keys are stored in an HSM, theHSM interaction channel should be protected to prevent interception of encryption or decryption operations. 3.6.1.2 Secret and private keys used to protectstored account data are stored in one (or more) ofthe following forms at all times: Encrypted with a key -encrypting key that is atleast as strong as the data- encrypting key, andthat is stored separately from the data-encrypting key. Within a secure cryptographic device (SCD), such as a hardware security module (HSM) or PTS-approved point -of-interaction device. As at least two full -length key components orkey shares, in accordance with an industry -accepted method.3.6.1.2.a Examine documented procedures toverify it is defined that cryptographic keys used toencrypt decrypt stored account data must exist only in one (or more) of the forms specified in this requirement.3.6.1.2.b Examine system configurations and keystorage locations to verify that cryptographic keys used to encrypt decrypt stored account data exist in one (or more) of the forms specified in thisrequirement.3.6.1.2.c Wherever key -encrypting keys are used,examine system configurations and key storagelocations to verify: Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting keys they protect. Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting keys. Customized Approach ObjectiveSecret and private keys are stored in a secure form that prevents unauthorized retrieval or access.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesIt is not required that public keys be stored in one ofthese forms.Cryptographic keys stored as part of a key management system (KMS) that employs SCDs are acceptable.A cryptographic key that is split into two parts does not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys stored as key components or key shares must be generated via one of the following: Using an approved random number generatorand within an SCD ,OR According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industrystandard for generation of secret key shares.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRestricting the number of people who have access to cleartext cryptographic key components reduce s therisk of stored account data being retrieved or renderedvisible by unauthorized parties.Good PracticeOnly personnel with defined key custodianresponsibilities (creating, altering, rotating, distributing,or otherwise maintaining encryption keys ) should begranted access to key components.Ideally this will be a very small number of people. 3.6.1.3 Access to cleartext cryptographic keycomponents is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary. 3.6.1.3 Examine user access lists to verify thataccess to cleartext cryptographic key components is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess to cleartext cryptographic key components is restricted to necessary personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeStoring any cryptographic keys in the fewest locationshelps an organization track and monitor all key locations and minimizes the potential for keys to be exposed to unauthorized parties. 3.6.1.4 Cryptographic keys are stored in the fewestpossible locations. 3.6.1.4 Examine key storage locations and observeprocesses to verify that keys are stored in the fewest possible locations.Customized Approach ObjectiveCryptographic keys are retained only wherenecessary.Requirements and Testing Procedures

Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUse of strong cryptographic keys significantly increasesthe level of security of encrypted account data.Further InformationSee the sources referenced at Cryptographic KeyGeneration in Appendix G . 3.7.1 Key-management policies and procedures areimplemented to include generation of strong cryptographic keys used to protect stored accountdata. 3.7.1.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used forprotection of stored account data to verify that theydefine generation of strong cryptographic keys.3.7.1.b Observe the method for generating keys toverify that strong keys are generated.Customized Approach ObjectiveStrong cryptographic keys are generated.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSecure distribution or conveyance of secret or privatecryptographic keys means that keys are distributed only to authorized custodians, as identified in Requirement 3.6.1.2, and are never distributed insecurely. 3.7.2 Key-management policies and procedures areimplemented to include secure distribution of cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data. 3.7.2.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data to verify that they define secure distribution of cryptographic keys.3.7.2.b Observe the method for distributing keys toverify that keys are distributed securely.Customized Approach ObjectiveCryptographic keys are secured during distribution.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeStoring keys without proper protection could provideaccess to attackers, resulting in the decryption and exposure of account data.Good PracticeData encryption keys can be protected by encrypting them with a key -encrypting key.Keys can be stored in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).Secret or private keys that can decrypt data shouldnever be present in source code. 3.7.3 Key-management policies and procedures areimplemented to include secure storage of cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data. 3.7.3.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data to verify that they define secure storage of cryptographic keys.3.7.3.b Observe the method for storing keys toverify that keys are stored securely.Customized Approach ObjectiveCryptographic keys are secured when stored.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeChanging encryption keys when they reach the end oftheir cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someone obtaining the encryption keys and using them to decrypt data.DefinitionsA cryptoperiod is the time span during which acryptographic key can be used for its defined purpose.Cryptoperiods are often defined in terms of the period for which the key is active and or the amount of cipher -text that has been produced by the key. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and thesensitivity of the data being encrypted.Further InformationNIST SP 800 -57 Part 1, Revision 5, Section 5.3Cryptoperiods - provides guidance for establishing thetime span during which a specific key is authorized foruse by legitimate entities, or the keys for a given system will remain in effect. See Table 1 of SP 800 -57Part 1 for suggested cryptoperiods for different keytypes. 3.7.4 Key management policies and procedures areimplemented for cryptographic key changes for keysthat have reached the end of their cryptoperiod, as defined by the associated application vendor or key owner, and based on industry best practices andguidelines, including the following: A defined cryptoperiod for each key type in use. A process for key changes at the end of thedefined cryptoperiod. 3.7.4.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data to verify that theydefine changes to cryptographic keys that have reached the end of their cryptoperiod and includeall elements specified in this requirement.3.7.4.b Interview personnel, examinedocumentation, and observe key storage locationsto verify that keys are changed at the end of thedefined cryptoperiod(s). Customized Approach ObjectiveCryptographic keys are not used beyond theirdefined cryptoperiod.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeKeys that are no longer required, keys with weakenedintegrity, and keys that are known or suspected to be compromised, should be archived, revoked, and or destroyed to ensure that the keys can no longer be used.If such keys need to be kept (for example, to supportarchived encrypted data), they should be stronglyprotected.Good PracticeArchived cryptographic keys should be used only for decryption verification purposes.The encryption solution should provide for and facilitate a process to replace keys that are due for replacementor that are known to be, or suspected of being,compromised. In addition, any keys that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity's incident response plan per Requirement 12.10.1.Further InformationIndustry best practices for archiving retired keys areoutlined in NIST SP 800 -57 Part 1, Revision 5, Section8.3.1 , and includes maintaining the archive with atrusted third party and storing archived key information separately from operational data. 3.7.5 Key management policies procedures areimplemented to include the retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys used to protect stored account data , as deemed necessary when: The key has reached the end of its definedcryptoperiod. The integrity of the key has been weakened,including when personnel with knowledge of a cleartext key component leaves the company, or the role for which the key component was known. The key is suspected of or known to becompromised.Retired or replaced keys are not used for encryption operations. 3.7.5.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify that they define retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys in accordance with all elements specified inthis requirement.3.7.5.b Interview personnel to verify that processesare implemented in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveKeys are removed from active use when it is suspected or known that the integrity of the key is weakened.Applicability NotesIf retired or replaced cryptographic keys need to be retained, these keys must be securely archived (for example, by using a key -encryption key).Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSplit knowledge and dual control of keys are used toeliminate the possibility of a single person having access to the whole key and therefore being able to gain unauthorized access to the data.DefinitionsSplit knowledge is a method in which two or morepeople separately have key components, where eachperson knows only their own key component, and the individual key components convey no knowledge of other components or of the original cryptographic key.Dual control requires two or more people to authenticate the use of a cryptographic key or perform a key -management function. No single person canaccess or use the authentication factor (for example,the password, PIN, or key) of another.Good PracticeWhere key components or key shares are used, procedures should ensure that no single custodian ever has access to sufficient key components or shares to reconstruct the cryptographic key. For example, in an m-of-n scheme (for example, Shamir), where only t woof any three components are required to reconstruct the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have current or prior knowledge of more than one component. If a custodian was previously assigned component A, which was then reassigned, the custodian should not then be assigned component B or C, as this would give the custodian knowledge of two components and the abilityto recreate the key.(continued on next page) 3.7.6 Where manual cleartext cryptographic key -management operations are performed bypersonnel, key -management policies andprocedures are implemented, including managingthese operations using split knowledge and dualcontrol. 3.7.6.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used forprotection of stored account data and verify thatthey define using split knowledge and dual control.3.7.6.b Interview personnel and or observeprocesses to verify that manual cleartext keys are managed with split knowledge and dual control.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by anyone. Operations involving cleartext keys cannot be carried out by a single person.Applicability NotesThis control is applicable for manual key -management operations.A cryptographic key that is simply split into two partsdoes not meet this requirement. Secret or privatekeys stored as key components or key shares must be generated via one of the following: Using an approved random number generatorand within a secure cryptographic device (SCD), such as a hardware security module (HSM) or PTS-approved point -of-interaction device ,OR According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industry standard for generation of secret key shares.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance3.7.6 (continued) ExamplesKey-management operations that might be performedmanually include, but are not limited to, key generation,transmission, loading, storage, and destruction.Further InformationIndustry standards for managing key componentsinclude: NIST SP 800 -57 Part 2, Revision 1 --Recommendation for Key Management: Part 2 -Best Practices for Key Management Organizations[4.6 Keying Material Distribution] ISO 11568- 2 Banking - Key management (retail)- Part 2 : Symmetric ciphers, their keymanagement and life cycle [4.7.2.3 Keycomponents and 4.9.3 Key components] European Payments Council EPC342-08 Guidelines on Cryptographic Algorithms Usage andKey Management [especially 4.1.4 Key installation].Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf an attacker is able to substitute an entity's key with akey the attacker knows, the attacker will be able todecrypt all data encrypted with that key.Good PracticeThe encryption solution should not allow for or acceptsubstitution of keys from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes.Controls should include ensuring that individuals withaccess to key components or shares do not haveaccess to other components or shares that form thenecessary threshold to derive the key. 3.7.7 Key management policies and procedures areimplemented to include the prevention of unauthorized substitution of cryptographic keys. 3.7.7.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify thatthey define prevention of unauthorized substitution of cryptographic keys.3.7.7.b Interview personnel and or observeprocesses to verify that unauthorized substitution of keys is prevented. Customized Approach ObjectiveCryptographic keys cannot be substituted byunauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThis process will help ensure individuals that act as keycustodians commit to the key -custodian role andunderstand and accept the responsibilities. An annual reaffirmation can help remind key custodians of their responsibilities.Further InformationIndustry guidance for key custodians and their rolesand responsibilities includes: NIST SP 800 -130 A Framework for DesigningCryptographic Key Management Systems [5. Rolesand Responsibilities (especially) for Key Custodians] ISO 11568- 1 Banking -- Key management (retail) --Part 1 : Principles [5 Principles of key management(especially b)] 3.7.8 Key management policies and procedures areimplemented to include that cryptographic key custodians formally acknowledge (in writing or electronically) that they understand and accept their key-custodian responsibilities. 3.7.8.a Examine the documented key -managementpolicies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify thatthey define acknowledgment s for key custodians inaccordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.3.7.8.b Examine documentation or other evidenceshowing that key custodians have providedacknowledgment s in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveKey custodians are knowledgeable about their responsibilities in relation to cryptographic operations and can access assistance and guidancewhen required.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeProviding guidance to customers on how to securelytransmit, store, and update cryptographic keys can help prevent keys from being mismanaged or disclosed to unauthorized entities.Further InformationNumerous industry standards for key management arecited above in the Guidance for Requirements 3.7.1-3.7.8. 3.7.9 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Where a service provider sharescryptographic keys with its customers for transmission or storage of account data, guidance on secure transmission, storage and updating ofsuch keys is documented and distributed to theservice provider 's customers. 3.7.9 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: If the serviceprovider shares cryptographic keys with its customers for transmission or storage of account data, examine the documentation that the serviceprovider provides to its customers to verify itincludes guidance on how to securely transmit, store, and update customers' keys in accordancewith all elements specified in Requirements 3.7.1 through 3.7.8 above.Customized Approach ObjectiveCustomers are provided with appropriate key management guidance whenever they receive shared cryptographic keys.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.Requirement 4: Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, PublicNetworksSections4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networ ks aredefined and understood.4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmissionOverviewThe use of strong cryptography provides greater assurance in preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and non- repudiation.To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals,including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocolscontinue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments(CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity's internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS sincethat network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS requirements.Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is recommended.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of strong cryptography and other PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networ ks aredefined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 4.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 4. While it is important to define the specific policiesor procedures called out in Requirement 4, it isequally important to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For thisreason, consider updating these documents assoon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that arefollowed to achieve the desired result in aconsistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected personnel, and are supported by operating procedures describing how to perform activities. 4.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 4 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 4.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 4 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 4 are defined andadhered to by affected personnel. All supportingactivities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintainedwithin separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 4.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 4 are documented, assigned, and understood. 4.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 4 are documented and assigned.4.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 4 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 4 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSensitive information must be encrypted duringtransmission over public networks because it is easy and common for a malicious individual tointercept and or divert data while in transit.Good PracticeThe network and data -flow diagrams defined inRequirement 1 are useful resource s for identifyingall connection points where account data istransmitted or received over open, publicnetworks.While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications.PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data istransmitted, or both. While it is not required thatstrong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encryptedat the session level, designated key custodiansshould be assigned responsibility for managingtransmission keys and certificates.(continued on next page) 4.2.1 Strong cryptography and security protocolsare implemented as follows to safeguard PANduring transmission over open, public networks: Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted. Certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are confirmed as valid and are not expired or revoked. This bullet is a best practice until itseffective date; r efer to applicability notes belowfor details. The protocol in use supports only secureversions or configurations and does not supportfallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations. The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use. 4.2.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.4.2.1.b Examine system configurations to verifythat strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.4.2.1.c Examine cardholder data transmissions toverify that all PAN is encrypted with strongcryptography when it is transmitted over open,public networks.4.2.1.d Examine system configurations to verifythat keys and or certificates that cannot be verifiedas trusted are rejected.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from any transmissions over open, public networks.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Some protocol implementations (such as SSL,SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical thatentities maintain awareness of industry -defineddeprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newerversions or protocols when older ones are nolonger deemed secure.Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to -dateCertif icate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or OnlineCertificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates.Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review sourcecode to ensure that clients and servers rejectconnections if the certificate is bad.For browser -based TLS certificates, certificatetrust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar.(continued on next page) A self -signed certificate may also be acceptable ifthe certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate's author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified- for example, via hashor signature-and has not expired.The bullet above (for confirming that certificatesused to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are valid and are not expired or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025,after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCIDSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance4.2.1 (continued) ExamplesOpen, public networks include, but are not limitedto: The Internet and Wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi,Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellitecommunications.Further InformationVendor recommendations and industry best practices can be consulted for information about the proper encryption strength specific to the encryption methodology in use.For more information about strong cryptographyand secure protocols, see industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800 -52 and SP800-57 .For more information about trusted keys andcertificates, see NIST Cybersecurity PracticeGuide Special Publication 1800-16, Securing WebTransactions: Transport Layer Security (TLS)Server Certificate Management.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe inventory of trusted keys helps the entitykeep track of the algorithms, protocols, key strength, key custodians, and key expiry dates. This enables the entity to respond quickly to vulnerabilities discovered in encryption software, certificates, and c ryptographic algorithms.Good PracticeFor certificates, the inventory should include the issuing CA and certification expiration date. 4.2.1.1 An inventory of the entity's trusted keys andcertificates used to protect PAN during transmissionis maintained. 4.2.1.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify processes are defined for the entity to maintain an inventory of its trusted keys and certificates.4.2.1.1.b Examine the inventory of trusted keysand certificates to verify it is kept up to date.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll keys and certificates used to protect PAN during transmission are identified and confirmed as trusted.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSince wireless networks do not require physicalmedia to connect, it is important to establish controls limiting who can connect and what transmission protocols will be used. Malicious users use free and widely available tools to eavesdrop on wireless comm unications. Use ofstrong cryptography can help limit disclosure of sensitive information across wireless networks.Wireless networks present unique risks to anorganization; therefore, they must be identified and protected according to industry requirements. Strong cryptography for authentication and transmission of PAN is required to preventmalicious users from gaining access to thewireless network or utilizing wireless networks to access other internal networks or data.Good PracticeWireless networks should not permit fallback or downgrade to an insecure protocol or lowerencryption strength that does not meet the intent of strong cryptography.Further InformationReview the vendor's specific documentation for more details on the choice of protocols,configurations, and settings related to cryptography. 4.2.1.2 Wireless networks transmitting PAN orconnected to the CDE use industry best practices to implement strong cryptography for authenticationand transmission. 4.2.1.2 Examine system configurations to verifythat wireless networks transmitting PAN or connected to the CDE use industry best practices to implement strong cryptography for authentication and transmission.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from wireless network transmissions.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEnd-user messaging technologies typically can beeasily intercepted by packet -sniffing duringdelivery across internal and public networks.Good PracticeThe use of end-user messaging technology to send PAN should only be considered where thereis a defined business need and should becontrolled through the Acceptable Use Policies forend-user technologies defined by the entityaccording to Requirement 12.2.1.ExamplesE-mail, instant messaging, SMS, and chat are examples of the type of end-user messagingtechnology that this requirement refers to. 4.2.2 PAN is secured with strong cryptographywhenever it is sent via end-user messagingtechnologies. 4.2.2.a Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify that processes are defined to secure PAN with strong cryptography whenever sent over end -user messaging technologies.4.2.2.b Examine system configurations and vendordocumentation to verify that PAN is secured with strong cryptography whenever it is sent via end-user messaging technologies.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from transmissions using end- user messagingtechnologies.Applicability NotesThis requirement also applies if a customer , or otherthird party , requests that PAN is sent to them viaend-user messaging technologies.There could be occurrences where an entity receives unsolicited cardholder data via an insecurecommunication channel that was not intended for transmissions of sensitive data. In this situation, the entity can choose to either include the channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it according to PCI DSS or delete the cardholder data andimplement measures to prevent the channel frombeing used for cardholder data.Maintain a Vulnerability Management ProgramRequirement 5: Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious SoftwareSections5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.OverviewMalicious software (malware) is software or firmware designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's knowledge orconsent, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the owner's data, applications , or operating system.Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links .Malware can enter the network during many business -approved activities, including employee e- mail (for example, via phishing) and use of theInternet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.Using anti -malware solutions that address all types of malware helps to protect systems from current and evolving malware threats.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 5.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 5. While it isimportant to define the specific policies orprocedures called out in Requirement 5, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented,maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For thisreason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycl e.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define thecontrols, methods, and processes that are followedto achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 5.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 5 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 5.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies andoperational procedures identified in Requirement 5are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 5 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, andconform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, networks and systems may not be properly protected from malware.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained withinseparate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities,entities can consider having personnel acknowledgetheir acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is aresponsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 5.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 5 are documented, assigned, and understood. 5.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 5 are documented and assigned.5.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 5 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 5 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented , or detected and addressed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThere is a constant stream of attacks targetingnewly discovered vulnerabilities in systems previously regarded as secure. Without an anti-malware solution that is updated regularly, newforms of malware can be used to attack systems,disable a network, or compromise data.Good PracticeIt is beneficial for entities to be aware of zero-day attacks (those that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability) and consider solutions that focus onbehavioral characteristics and will alert and react tounexpected behavior.DefinitionsSystem components known to be affected by malware have active malware exploits available in the real world (not only theoretical exploits). 5.2.1 An anti-malware solution(s) is deployed on allsystem components, except for those systemcomponents identified in periodic evaluations perRequirement 5.2.3 that concludes the system components are not at risk from malware. 5.2.1.a Examine system components to verify thatan anti-malware solution(s) is deployed on allsystem components, except for those determinedto not be at risk from malware based on periodic evaluations per Requirement 5.2.3.5.2.1.b For any system components without ananti-malware solution, examine the periodicevaluations to verify the component was evaluated and the evaluation concludes that the component is not at risk from malware. Customized Approach ObjectiveAutomated mechanisms are implemented to prevent systems from becoming an attack vector for malware.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important to protect against all types and formsof malware to prevent unauthorized access.Good PracticeAnti-malware solutions may include a combination of network -based controls, host -based controls, andendpoint security solutions. In addition to signature-based tools, capabilities used by modern anti-malware solutions include sandboxing, privilege escalat ion controls, and machine learning.Solution techniques include preventing malware from getting into the network and removing or containing malware that does get into the network.ExamplesTypes of malware include, but are not limited to,viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links. 5.2.2 The deployed anti-malware solution(s): Detects all known types of malware. Removes, blocks, or contains all known types of malware. 5.2.2 Examine vendor documentation andconfigurations of the anti -malware solution(s) toverify that the solution: Detects all known types of malware. Removes, blocks, or contains all known typesof malware.Customized Approach ObjectiveMalware cannot execute or infect other systemcomponents.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCertain systems, at a given point in time, may notcurrently be commonly targeted or affected by malware. However, industry trends for malware can change quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their syste ms-for example, by monitoring vendorsecurity notices and anti- malware forums todetermine whether its systems might be coming under threat from new and evolving malware.Good PracticeIf an entity determines that a particular system is not susceptible to any malware, the determination should be supported by industry evidence, vendorresources, and best practices.The following steps can help entities during theirperiodic evaluations: Identification of all system types previously determined to not require malware protection. Review of industry vulnerability alerts and notices to determine if new threats exist for any identified system. A documented conclusion about whether the system types remain not susceptible to malware. A strategy to add malware protection for any system types for which malware protection has become necessary.Trends in malware should be included in the identification of new security vulnerabilities atRequirement 6.3.1, and methods to address newtrends should be incorporated into the entity's configuration standards and protection mechanisms as needed. 5.2.3 Any system components that are not at risk formalware are evaluated periodically to include the following: A documented list of all system components not at risk for malware. Identification and evaluation of evolvingmalware threats for those system components. Confirmation whether such system componentscontinue to not require anti-malware protection. 5.2.3.a Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify that a process is defined for periodic evaluations of any system componentsthat are not at risk for malware that includes all elements specified in this requirement.5.2.3.b Interview personnel to verify that theevaluations include all elements specified in this requirement.5.2.3.c Examine the list of system componentsidentified as not at risk of malware and compare to the system components without an anti -malwaresolution deployed per Requirement 5.2.1 to verify that the system components match for bothrequirements. Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity maintains awareness of evolving malwarethreats to ensure that any systems not protectedfrom malware are not at risk of infection.Applicability NotesSystem components covered by this requirementare those for which there is no anti -malware solutiondeployed per Requirement 5.2.1.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEntities determine the optimum period to undertakethe evaluation based on criteria such as the complexity of each entity's environment and the number of types of systems that are required to be evaluated. 5.2.3.1 The frequency of periodic evaluations ofsystem components identified as not at risk for malware is defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. 5.2.3.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of periodic evaluations of system components identified as not at risk for malware to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified inRequirement 12.3.1.5.2.3.1.b Examine documented results of periodicevaluations of system components identified as notat risk for malware and interview personnel toverify that evaluations are performed at thefrequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis performed for this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveSystems not known to be at risk from malware arere-evaluated at a frequency that addresses the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance5.3 Anti -malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFor an anti- malware solution to remain effective, itneeds to have the latest security updates,signatures, threat analysis engines, and any othermalware protections on which the solution relies.Having an automated update process avoidsburdening end users with responsibility for manually installing updates and provides greater assurance that anti -malware protection mechanisms areupdated as quickly as possible after an update is released.Good PracticeAnti-malware mechanisms should be updated via a trusted source as soon as possible after an update is available. Using a trusted common source to distribute updates to end-user systems helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the solution architecture.Updates may be automatically downloaded to acentral location-for example, to allow for testing-prior to being deployed to individual system components. 5.3.1 The anti -malware solution(s) is kept currentvia automatic updates. 5.3.1.a Examine anti -malware solution(s)configurations, including any master installation ofthe software, to verify the solution is configured toperform automatic updates.5.3.1.b Examine system components and logs, toverify that the anti -malware solution(s) anddefinitions are current and have been promptly deployed Customized Approach ObjectiveAnti-malware mechanisms can detect and addressthe latest malware threats.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePeriodic scans can identify malware that is present,but currently inactive, within the environment. Some malware, such as zero-day malware, can enter an environment before the scan solution is capable of detecting it. Performing regular periodic scans or continuous behavioral analysis of systems orprocesses helps ensure that previouslyundetectable malware can be identified, removed,and investigated to determine how it gained access to the environment.Good PracticeUsing a combination of periodic scans (scheduledand on-demand) and active, real -time (on -access)scanning helps ensure that malware residing in both static and dynamic elements of the CDE is addressed. Users should also be able to run on-demand scans on t heir systems if suspicious activityis detected - this can be useful in the earlydetection of malware.Scans should include the entire file system,including all disks, memory, and start -up files andboot records (at system restart) to detect all malware upon file execution, including any software that may be resident on a system but not currently active. S can scope should include all systems andsoftware in the CDE, including those that are often overlooked such as email servers, web browsers, and instant messaging software.DefinitionsActive, or real- time, scanning checks files formalware upon any attempt to open, close, rename, or otherwise interact with a file, preventing the malware from being activated. 5.3.2 The anti -malware solution(s): Performs periodic scans and active or real- timescans.OR Performs continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes. 5.3.2.a Examine anti -malware solution(s)configurations, including any master installation of the software, to verify the solution(s) is configured to perform at least one of the elements specified in this requirement.5.3.2.b Examine system components, including alloperating system types identified as at risk for malware, to verify the solution(s) is enabled inaccordance with at least one of the elementsspecified in this requirement.5.3.2.c Examine logs and scan results to verify thatthe solution(s) is enabled in accordance with atleast one of the elements specified in this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveMalware cannot complete execution.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEntities can determine the optimum period toundertake periodic scans based on their own assessment of the risks posed to their environments. 5.3.2.1 If periodic malware scans are performed tomeet Requirement 5.3.2, t he frequency of scans isdefined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. 5.3.2.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of periodic malware scans to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1.5.3.2.1.b Examine documented results of periodicmalware scans and interview personnel to verify scans are performed at the frequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis performed for thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveScans by the malware solution are performed at afrequency that addresses the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to entities conduc tingperiodic malware scans to meet Requirement 5.3.2.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePortable media devices are often overlooked as anentry method for malware. Attackers will often pre-load malware onto portable devices such as USB and flash drives; connecting an infected device to a computer then triggers the malware, introducing new threats within the environment. 5.3.3 For removable electronic media, the anti -malware solution(s) : Performs automatic scans of when the media is inserted, connected, or logically mounted,OR Performs continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes when the media isinserted, connected, or logically mounted. 5.3.3.a Examine anti -malware solution( s)configurations to verify that, for removableelectronic media, the solution is configured to perform at least one of the elements specified in this requirement.5.3.3.b Examine system components withremovable electronic media connected to verify that the solution(s) is enabled in accordance withat least one of the elements as specified in thisrequirement.5.3.3.c Examine logs and scan results to verify thatthe solution(s) is enabled in accordance with atleast one of the elements specified in thisrequirement . Customized Approach ObjectiveMalware cannot be introduced to systemcomponents via external removable media.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important to track the effectiveness of the anti -malware mechanisms -for example, by confirmingthat updates and scans are being performed asexpected, and that malware is identified and addressed. Audit logs also allow an entity todetermine how malware entered the environmentand track its activity when inside the entity'snetwork. 5.3.4 Audit logs for the anti -malware solution(s) areenabled and retained in accordance with Requirement 10.5.1. 5.3.4 Examine anti-malware solution(s)configurations to verify logs are enabled and retained in accordance with Requirement 10.5.1.Customized Approach ObjectiveHistorical records of anti -malware actions areimmediately available and retained for at least 12months.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important that defensive mechanisms arealways running so that malware is detected in real time. Ad -hoc starting and stopping of anti- malwaresolutions could allow malware to propagate unchecked and undetected.Good PracticeWhere there is a legitimate need to temporarilydisable a system's anti- malware protection-forexample, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem -the reasonfor taking such action should be understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of anti -malware mechanisms, including on administrators' own devices, should be performed by authorized personnel. It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable anti -malware on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such software is disabled and then follow up that occurs to ensure correct processes were followed.ExamplesAdditional security measures that may need to be implemented for the period during which anti -malware protection is not active include disconnecting the unprotected system from the Internet while the anti -malware protection isdisabled and running a full scan once it is re-enabled. 5.3.5 Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabledor altered by users, unless specifically documented,and authorized by management on a case- by-casebasis for a limited time period. 5.3.5.a Examine anti -malware configurations, toverify that the anti -malware mechanisms cannot bedisabled or altered by users.Customized Approach Objective 5.3.5.b Interview responsible personnel andobserve processes to verify that any requests to disable or alter anti -malware mechanisms arespecifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by -case basis for a limitedtime period. Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be modified by unauthorized personnel.Applicability NotesAnti-malware solutions may be temporarily disabled only if there is a legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by -casebasis. If anti -malware protection needs to bedisabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period during which anti-malware protection is not active.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance5.4 Anti -phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTechnical controls can limit the number of occasionspersonnel have to evaluate the veracity of acommunication and can also limit the effects of individual responses to phishing.Good PracticeWhen developing anti -phishing controls, entities areencouraged to consider a combination of approaches. For example, using anti -spoofingcontrols such as Domain -based MessageAuthentication, Reporting Conformance(DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) will help stop phishers from spoofing the entity's domain andimpersonating personnel.The deployment of technologies for blockingphishing emails and malware before they reach personnel, such as link scrubbers and server -sideanti-malware, can reduce incidents and decreasethe time required by personnel to check and report phishing attacks. Additionally, training personnel to recognize and report phishing emails can allow similar emails to be identified and permit them to beremoved before being opened.It is recommended (but not required) that anti-phishing controls are applied across an entity'sentire organization.(continued on next page) 5.4.1 Processes and automated mechanisms are inplace to detect and protect personnel againstphishing attacks. 5.4.1 Observe implemented processes andexamine mechanisms to verify controls are in placeto detect and protect personnel against phishingattacks.Customized Approach ObjectiveMechanisms are in place to protect against and mitigate risk posed by phishing attacks.Applicability NotesThe focus of this requirement is on protecting personnel with access to system components in -scope for PCI DSS.Meeting this requirement for technical and automated controls to detect and protect personnel against phishing is not the same as Requirement 12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting this requirement does not also meet the requirement for providin g personnel with security awarenesstraining, and vice versa.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance5.4.1 (continued) DefinitionsPhishing is a form of social engineering anddescribes the different methods used by attackers to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive information, such as user account names and passwords, and account data . Attackers will typically disguisethemselves and attempt to appear as a genuine ortrusted source, directing personnel to send an emailresponse, click on a web link, or enter data into a compromised website. Mechanisms that can detect and prevent phishing attempts are often included inanti-malwar e solutions.Further InformationSee the following for more information about phishing:National Cyber Security Centre - Phishin g Attacks:Defending your Organization.US Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency - Report Phishing Sites.Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and SoftwareSections6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.6.4 Public -facing web applications are protected against attacks.6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.OverviewActors with bad intentions can use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendorprovided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All system components must have all appropriatesoftware patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of account data by malicious individuals and malicious software.Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflictwith existing security configurations. For bespoke and custom software, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by applying software lifecycle(SLC) processes and secure coding techniques.Code repositories that store application code, system configurations, or other configuration data that can impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data are in scope for PCI DSS assessments.See Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards on page 7 for information about the use of PCI SSC -validated softwareand software vendors , and how use of PCI SSC's software standards may help with meeting controls in Requirement 6.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Note : Requirement 6 applies to all system components, except for section 6.2 for developing software securely, which applies only to bespokeand custom software used on any system component included in or connected to the CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 6.1.1 is about effectively managing andmaintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 6. While it isimportant to define the specific policies or procedurescalled out in Requirement 6, it is equally important toensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For thisreason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycl e.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define thecontrols, methods, and processes that are followed toachieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 6.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 6 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 6.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 6 are managed in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meetingactivities within Requirement 6 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, andconform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned,systems will not be securely maintained, and their security level will be reduced.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained withinseparate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities,entities can consider having personnel acknowledgetheir acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is aresponsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 6.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 6 are documented, assigned, and understood. 6.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 6 are documented and assigned.6.1.2.b Interview personnel responsible forperforming activities in Requirement 6 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 6 are allocated. Personnelare accountable for successful, continuousoperation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout the inclusion of security during therequirements definition, design, analysis, and testing phases of software development, securityvulnerabilities can be inadvertently or maliciouslyintroduced into the production environment.Good PracticeUnderstanding how sensitive data is handled by the application- including when stored, transmitted, andin memory -can help identify where data needs to beprotected.PCI DSS requirements must be considered when developing software to meet those requirements by design, rather than trying to retrofit the software later.ExamplesSecure software lifecycle management methodologies and frameworks include PCI Software Security Framework, BSIMM, OPENSAMM, andworks from NIST, ISO, and SAFECode. 6.2.1 Bespoke and custom software are developedsecurely, as follows: Based on industry standards and or best practices for secure development. In accordance with PCI DSS (for example, secure authentication and logging). Incorporating consideration of information security issues during each stage of the software development lifecycle. 6.2.1 Examine documented software developmentprocedures to verify that processes are defined that include all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveBespoke and custom software is developed in accordance with PCI DSS and secure development processes throughout the software lifecycle.Applicability NotesThis applies to all software developed for or by theentity for the entity's own use. This includes both bespoke and custom software. This does not apply to third -party software.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHaving staff knowledgeable in secure codingmethods, including techniques defined in Requirement 6.2.4, will help minimize the number of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor coding practices.Good PracticeTraining for developers may be provided in-house or by third parties.Training should include, but is not limited to, development languages in use, secure software design, secure coding techniques, use of techniques methods for finding vulnerabilities in code, processes to prevent reintroducing previouslyresolved vulnerabilities, and how to use anyautomated security testing tools for detecting vulnerabilities in software.As industry -accepted secure coding practiceschange, organizational coding practices and developer training may need to be updated to address new threats. 6.2.2 Software development personnel working onbespoke and custom software are trained at least once every 12 months as follows: On software security relevant to their job function and development languages. Including secure software design and securecoding techniques. Including, if security testing tools are used, howto use the tools for detecting vulnerabilities in software. 6.2.2.a Examine software development proceduresto verify that processes are defined for training of software development personnel developing bespoke and custom software that includes all elements specified in this requirement.6.2.2.b Examine training records and interviewpersonnel to verify that software development personnel working on bespoke and custom software received software security training that is relevant to their job function and developmentlanguages in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveSoftware development personnel remain knowledgeable about secure development practices; software security; and attacks against thelanguages, frameworks, or applications theydevelop. Personnel are able to access assistanceand guidance when required.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSecurity vulnerabilities in bespoke and customsoftware are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to a network and compromise account data.Vulnerable code is far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released intoproduction environments. Requiring a formal reviewand signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been deve loped in accordance with policies andprocedures.Good PracticeThe following items should be considered forinclusion in code reviews: Searching for undocumented features (implanttools, backdoors). Confirming that software securely uses external components' functions (libraries, frameworks, APIs, etc.). For example, if a third -party libraryproviding cryptographic functions is used, verify that it was integrated securely. Checking for correct use of logging to prevent sensitive data from getting into logs. Analysis of insecure code structures that may contain potential vulnerabilities related to common software attacks identified in Requirement 6.2.4. Checking the application's behavior to detectlogical vulnerabilities. 6.2.3 Bespoke and custom software is reviewedprior to being released into production or tocustomers, to identify and correct potential coding vulnerabilities, as follows: Code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines. Code reviews look for both existing and emerging software vulnerabilities. Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release. 6.2.3.a Examine documented softwaredevelopment procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that processes are defined that require all bespoke and custom software to be reviewed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.2.3.b Examine evidence of changes to bespokeand custom software to verify that the code changes were reviewed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveBespoke and custom software cannot be exploited via coding vulnerabilities.Applicability NotesThis requirement for code reviews applies to all bespoke and custom software (both internal and public facing), as part of the system developmentlifecycle.Public -facing web applications are also subject toadditional controls, to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.Code reviews may be performed using either manual or automated processes, or a combination of both.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHaving code reviewed by someone other than theoriginal author, who is both experienced in code reviews and knowledgeable about secure coding practices, minimizes the possibility that code containing security or logic errors that could affect the security of cardholder data is released into aproduction environment. Requiring managementapproval that the code was reviewed limits the ability for the process to be bypassed.Good PracticeHaving a formal review methodology and review checklists has been found to improve the quality of the code review process.Code review is a tiring process , and for this reason, itis most effective when reviewers only review small amounts of code at a time.To maintain the effectiveness of code reviews , it isbeneficial to monitor the general workload of reviewers and to have them review applications theyare familiar with.Code reviews may be performed using either manualor automated processes, or a combination of both.Entitles that rely solely on manual code reviewshould ensure that reviewers maintain their skills through regular training as new vulnerabilities are found, and new secure coding methods are recommended.Further InformationSee the OWASP Code Review Guide. 6.2.3.1 If manual code reviews are performed forbespoke and custom software prior to release to production, code changes are: Reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author, and who are knowledgeable about code-review techniquesand secure coding practices. Reviewed and approved by management priorto release. 6.2.3.1.a If manual code reviews are performed forbespoke and custom software prior to release to production, examine documented software development procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that processes are defined for manual code reviews to be conducted inaccordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.6.2.3.1.b Examine evidence of changes tobespoke and custom software and interviewpersonnel to verify that manual code reviews wereconducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveThe manual code review process cannot be bypassed and is effective at discovering security vulnerabilities.Applicability NotesManual code reviews can be conducted by knowledgeable internal personnel or knowledgeable third-party personn el.An individual that has been formally granted accountability for release control and who is neither the original code author nor the code reviewer fulfil lsthe criteria of being management.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDetecting or preventing common errors that result invulnerable code as early as possible in the softwaredevelopment process lowers the probability that such errors make it through to production and lead to a compromise. Having formal engineering techniques and tools embedded in the development process will catch these errors early. This philosophy issometimes called shifting security left.Good PracticeFor both bespoke and custom software, the entitymust ensure that code is developed focusing on theprevention or mitigation of common software attacks,including: Attempts to exploit common coding vulnerabilities (bugs). Attempts to exploit software design flaws. Attempts to exploit implementation configuration flaws. Enumeration attacks - automated attacks that areactively exploited in payments and abuseidentification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms. See the PCI Perspectives blogarticle Beware of Account Testing Attacks .(continued on next page) 6.2.4 Software engineering techniques or othermethods are defined and in use by softwaredevelopment personnel to prevent or mitigate common software attacks and related vulnerabilitiesin bespoke and custom software, including but notlimited to the following: Injection attacks, including SQL, LDAP, XPath,or other command, parameter, object, fault, or injection -type flaws. Attacks on data and data structures, includingattempts to manipulate buffers, pointers, inputdata, or shared data. Attacks on cryptography usage, includingattempts to exploit weak, insecure, or inappropriate cryptographic implementations,algorithms, cipher suites, or modes of operation. Attacks on business logic, including attempts toabuse or bypass application features andfunctionalities through the manipulation of APIs, communication protocols and channels, client -side functionality, or other system application functions and resources. This includes cross -sitescripting (XSS) and cross -site request forgery(CSRF). Attacks on access control mechanisms, including attempts to bypass or abuse identification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms, or attempts to exploit weaknessesin the implementation of such mechanisms. Attacks via any high-risk vulnerabilitiesidentified in the vulnerability identificationprocess, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1. 6.2.4 Examine documented procedures andinterview responsible software developmentpersonnel to verify that software engineering techniques or other methods are defined and in use by developers of bespoke and custom software to prevent or mitigate all commonsoftware attacks as specified in this requirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective Researching and documenting software engineeringtechniques or other methods helps to define how software developers prevent or mitigate various software attacks by features or countermeasures they build into software. This might include identification aut hentication mechanisms, accesscontrol, input validation routines, etc. Developersshould be familiar with different types ofvulnerabilities and potential attacks and use measures to avoid potential attack vectors when developing code.ExamplesTechniques include automated processes andpractices that scan code early in the developmentcycle when code is checked in to confirm thevulnerabilities are not present. Bespoke and custom software cannot be exploited via common attacks and related vulnerabilities.Applicability NotesThis applies to all software developed for or by the entity for the entity's own use. This includes both bespoke and custom software. This does not apply to third -party software.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeClassifying the risks (for example, as critical, high,medium, or low) allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items morequickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilitiesposing the greatest risk will be exploited.Good PracticeMethods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization's environment and risk -assessment strategy.When an entity is assigning its risk rankings, it shouldconsider using a formal, objective, justifiablemethodology that accurately portrays the risks of the vulnerabilities pertinent to the organization and translates to an appropriate entity -assigned pr iorityfor resolution.Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify allvulnerabilities considered to be a high risk to theenvironment. In addition to the risk ranking,vulnerabilities may be considered critical if theypose an imminent threat to the environment, impactcritical systems, and or would result in a potentialcompromise if not addressed. Examples of criticalsystems may include security systems, public -facingdevices and systems, databases, and other systemsthat store, process, or transmit cardholder data.(continued on next page) 6.3.1 Security vulnerabilities are identified andmanaged as follows: New security vulnerabilities are identified usingindustry -recognized sources for securityvulnerability information, including alerts from international and national computer emergency response teams (CERTs). Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based on industry best practices and consideration of potential impact. Risk rankings identify , at a minimum, allvulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or critical to the environment. Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and third-party software (for example operating systems and databases) are covered. 6.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures foridentifying and managing security vulnerabilities to verify that processes are defined in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.3.1.b Interview responsible personnel, examinedocumentation, and observe processes to verify that security vulnerabilities are identified andmanaged in accordance with all elements specifiedin this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveNew system and software vulnerabilities that may impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data are monitored,cataloged, and risk assessed.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes An organization's processes for managingvulnerabilities should be integrated with othermanagement processes -for example, riskmanagement, change management, patch management, incident response, application security, as well as proper monitoring and logging of these processes. This process should include multiplesources of vulnerability information, includingindustry -recognized vulnerability databases (forexample, the US National Vulnerability Database), CERTs, RSS feeds, information received from vendors and third parties, and vulnerabilities identified via internal and external vulnerability scans (Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2). This will help toensure all vulnerabilities are properly identified andaddressed. Processes should support ongoing evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk, could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited ona low -risk system that could result in access to theCDE.(continued on next page) This requirement is not achieved by, and is inaddition to, performing vulnerability scans according to Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2. This requirement is for a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability information and for the entity to determine the risk ranking to beassociated with each vulnerability.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.3.1 (continued) ExamplesSome organizations that issue alerts to adviseentities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring immediate patches updates are national Computer Emergency Readiness Response Teams (CERTs) and vendors.Criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may includecriticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert fromForum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) or a CERT, consideration of the CVSS score, the classification by the vendor, and or type of systems affected.Further InformationTrustworthy sources for vulnerability informationinclude vendor websites, industry newsgroups,mailing lists, etc. If software is developed in-house, the internal development team should also consider sources of information about new vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed applications . Othermethods to ensure new vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that automatically recognize and alert upon detection of unusual behavior. Processesshould account for widely published exploits as wellas zero -day attacks, which target previouslyunknown vulnerabilities.For bespoke and custom software, the organization may obtain information about libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for example, special resources andresources from component developers). Theorganizat ion may also independently analyze third -party components and identify vulnerabilities.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.3.1 (continued) For control over in-house developed software, theorganization may receive such information from external sources. The organization can consider using a bug bounty program where it posts information (for example, on its website) so third parties can contact the organization with vulnerability information. External sources may includeindependent investigators or companies that report tothe organization about identified vulnerabilities and may include sources such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) or the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIdentifying and listing all the entity's bespoke andcustom software, and any third -party software that isincorporated into the entity's bespoke and custom software enables the entity to manage vulnerabilities and patches.Vulnerabilities in third-party components (includinglibraries, APIs, etc.) embedded in an entity's softwarealso renders those applications vulnerable to attacks.Knowing which third-party components are used inthe entity's software and monitoring the availability of security patches to address known vulnerabilities is critical to ensuring the security of the software.Good PracticeAn entity's inventory should cover all payment software components and dependencies, including supported execution platforms or environments, third-party libraries, services, and other required functionalities.There are many different types of solutions that can help with managing software inventories, such as software composition analysis tools, applicationdiscovery tools, and mobile device management. 6.3.2 An inventory of bespoke and custom software,and third-party software components incorporatedinto bespoke and custom software is maintained to facilitate vulnerability and patch management. 6.3.2.a Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that an inventory of bespoke and custom software and third -party softwarecomponents incorporated into bespoke and custom software is maintained, and that the inventory is used to identify and address vulnerabilities.Customized Approach ObjectiveKnown vulnerabilities in third- party softwarecomponents cannot be exploited in bespoke andcustom software. 6.3.2.b Examine software documentation, includingfor bespoke and custom software that integrates third-party software components, and compare it tothe inventory to verify that the inventory includes the bespoke and custom software and third-party software components.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeNew exploits are constantly being discovered, andthese can permit attacks against systems that have previously been considered secure. If the most recent security patches updates are not implemented on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious actor can use these exploits to attack or disable asystem or gain access to sensitive data.Good PracticePrioritizing security patches updates for critical infrastructure ensures that high -priority systems anddevices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released.An entity's patching cadence should factor in any re-evaluation of vulnerabilities and subsequent changesin the criticality of a vulnerability per Requirement 6.3.1. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later.Additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on a low -risk system that could result inaccess to the CDE.(continued on next page) 6.3.3 All system components are protected fromknown vulnerabilities by installing applicable security patches updates as follows: Patches updates for critical vulnerabilities (identified according to the risk ranking process at Requirement 6.3.1) are installed within onemonth of release. All other applicable security patches updates areinstalled within an appropriate time frame as determined by the entity's assessment of the criticality of the risk to the environment as identified according to the risk ranking process at Requirement 6.3.1. 6.3.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifyprocesses are defined for addressing vulnerabilities by installing applicable security patches updates in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.3.3.b Examine system components and relatedsoftware and compare the list of installed security patches updates to the most recent security patch update information to verify vulnerabilities are addressed in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requir ement.Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be compromised viathe exploitation of a known vulnerability.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.3.3 (continued) It is recommended that the entity complete a targetedrisk analysis (TRA) according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1 to document the frequency of installing all other applicable security patches updates. This TRA would include consideration of the entity's assessment of the criticality of the risk to their environment as identifiedin the risk ranking process at Requirement 6.3.1.ExamplesAn example time frame for installation ofpatches updates could be 60 days for high-risk vulnerabilities and 90 days for others, as determined by the entity's assessment of risk.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.4 Public -facing web applications are protected against attacks.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePublic -facing web applications are those that areavailable to the public (not only for internal use).These applications are primary targets for attackers, and poorly coded web applications provide an easy path for attackers to gain access to sensitive dataand systems.Good PracticeManual or automated vulnerability securityassessment tools or methods review and or test the application for vulnerabilities.Common assessment tools include specialized webscanners that perform automatic analysis of web application protection.When using automated technical solutions, it is important to include processes that facilitate timelyresponses to alerts generated by the solutions sothat any detected attacks can be mitigated.ExamplesA web application firewall (WAF) installed in front of public -facing web applications to check all traffic is anexample of an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web- based attacks (forexample, the attacks included in Requirement 6.2.4) .WAFs filter and block non- essential traffic at theapplication layer. A properly configured WAF helps to prevent application- layer attacks on applications thatare improperly coded or configured.(continued on next page) 6.4.1 For public -facing web applications, new threatsand vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis and these applications are protected againstknown attacks as follows: Reviewing public -facing web applications viamanual or automated application vulnerabilitysecurity assessment tools or methods as follows:- At least once every 12 months and after significant changes.- By an entity that specializes in applicationsecurity.- Including, at a minimum, all commonsoftware attacks in Requirement 6.2.4.- All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance with requirement 6.3.1.- All vulnerabilities are corrected.- The application is re-evaluated after the corrections .OR Installing an automated technical solution(s) that continually detects and prevents web- basedattacks as follows:- Installed in front of public -facing webapplications to detect and prevent web-based attacks.- Actively running and up to date as applicable.- Generating audit logs .- Configured to either block web -basedattacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated.6.4.1 For public -facing web applications, ensurethat either one of the required methods is in place as follows: If manual or automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods are in use, examine documented processes, interview personnel, and examine records of application security assessments to verify that public -facing web applications are reviewed inaccordance with all elements of thisrequirement specific to the tool method.OR If an automated technical solution(s) is installedthat continually detects and prevents web-based attacks, examine the systemconfiguration settings and audit logs, and interview responsible personnel to verify that the automated technical solution(s) is installedin accordance with all elements of this requirement specific to the solution(s).Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective Another example of an automated technical solutionis Runtime Application Self -Protection (RASP)technologies. When implemented correctly, RASP solutions can detect and block anomalous behavior by the software during execution. While WAFs typically monitor the application perimeter, RASPsolutions monitor and block behavior within theapplication. Public -facing web applications are protected againstmalicious attacks.Applicability NotesThis assessment is not the same as the vulnerabilityscans performed for Requirement 11.3.1 and11.3.2.This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 6.4.2 after 31 March 2025 when Requirement 6.4.2 becomes effective.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePublic -facing web applications are primary targets forattackers, and poorly coded web applications providean easy path for attackers to gain access to sensitive data and systems.Good PracticeWhen using automated technical solutions, it isimportant to include processes that facilitate timelyresponses to alerts generated by the solutions so that any detected attacks can be mitigated. Such solutions may also be used to automate mitigation, for example rate-limiting controls, which can beimplemented to mitigate against brute-force attacks and enumeration attacks.ExamplesA web application firewall (WAF), which can be either on-premise or cloud-based, installed in front of public -facing web applications to check all traffic, isan example of an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web- based attacks (forexample, the attacks included in Requirement 6.2.4).WAFs filter and block non- essential traffic at theapplication layer. A properly configured WAF helps to prevent application- layer attacks on applications thatare improperly coded or configured. 6.4.2 For public -facing web applications , anautomated technical solution is deployed that continually detects and prevents web- based attacks,with at least the following: Is installed in front of public -facing webapplications and is configured to detect andprevent web- based attacks. Actively running and up to date as applicable. Generating audit logs . Configured to either block web -based attacks orgenerate an alert that is immediatelyinvestigated. 6.4.2 For public -facing web applications, examinethe system configuration settings and audit logs, and interview responsible personnel to verify that an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks is in place in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectivePubli c-facing web applications are protected in realtime against malicious attacks.Applicability NotesThis new requirement will replace Requirement6.4.1 once its effective date is reached.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeScripts loaded and executed in the payment pagecan have their functionality altered without the entity's knowledge and can also have the functionality to load additional external scripts (for example, advertising and tracking, tag management systems).Such seemingly harmless scripts can be used bypotential attackers to upload malicious scripts thatcan read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the consumer browser.Ensuring that the functionality of all such scripts is understood to be necessary for the operation of the payment page minimizes the number of scripts that could be tampered with.Ensuring that scripts have been explicitly authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary scripts being added to the payment page without appropriate management approval. Where it is impractical for such authorization to occur before a script is changedor a new script is added to the page, the authorization should be confirmed as soon aspossible after a change is made.Using techniques to prevent tampering with the script will minimize the probability of the script being modified to carry out unauthorized behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data from the payment page.(continued on next page)6.4.3 All payment page scripts that are loaded andexecuted in the consumer's browser are managedas follows: A method is implemented to confirm that each script is authorized. A method is implemented to assure the integrityof each script. An inventory of all scripts is maintained withwritten business or technical justification as towhy each is necessary. 6.4.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for managing all payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in the consumer's browser, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.4.3.b Interview responsible personnel andexamine inventory records and system configurations to verify that all payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in theconsumer's browser are managed in accordancewith all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized code cannot be executed in the payment page as it is rendered in the consumer's browser.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeScripts may be authorized by manual or automated(e.g., workflow) processes.Where the payment page will be loaded into an inline frame (iframe), restricting the location that the payment page can be loaded from, using the parent page's Content Security Policy (CSP) can help preventunauthorized content being substituted for thepayment page.Where an entity includes a TPSP's payment processor's embedded payment page form on its webpage, the entity should expect the TPSP payment processor to provide evidence that the TPSP payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordancewith the TPS P's payment processor's PCI DSSassessment and Requirement 12.9.ExamplesThe integrity of scripts can be enforced by severaldifferent mechanisms including, but not limited to: Sub-resource integrity (SRI), which allows theconsumer browser to validate that a script has not been tampered with. A CSP, which limits the locations the consumer browser can load a script from and transmit account data to. Proprietary script or tag -management systems,which can prevent malicious script execution. This requirement applies to all scripts loaded fromthe entity's environment and scripts loaded fromthird and fourth parties.This requirement also applies to scripts in the entity's webpage(s) that includes a TPSP's payment processor's embedded payment page form (for example, one or more inline frames or iframes).This requirement does not apply to an entity forscripts in a TPSP's payment processor's embeddedpayment page form (for example, one or more iframes), where the entity includes a TPSP's payment processor's payment page form on its webpage.Scripts in the TPSP's payment processor's embedded payment page form are the responsibility of the TPSP payment processor to manage inaccordance with this requirement.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeChange management procedures must be applied toall changes -including the addition, removal, ormodification of any system component -in theproduction environment. It is important to document the reason for a change and the change description so that relevant parties understand and agree the change is needed. Likewise, documenting the impacts of the change allows all affected parties to plan appropriately for any processing changes.Good PracticeApproval by authorized parties confirms that the change is legitimate and that the change is sanctioned by the organization. Changes should be approved by individuals with the appropriate authority and knowledge to understand the impact of the change.Thorough testing by the entity confirms that the security of the environment is not reduced byimplementing a change and that all existing securitycontrols either remain in place or are replaced with equal or stronger security controls after the change. The specific testing to be performed will varyaccording to the type of change and system component(s) affected.For each change, it is important to have documentedprocedures that address any failures and provideinstructions on how to return to a secure state in case the change fails or adversely affects the security of an application or system. These procedures will allowthe application or system to be restored to its previous secure state. 6.5.1 Changes to all system components in theproduction environment are made according to established procedures that include: Reason for, and description of, the change. Documentation of security impact. Documented change approval by authorized parties. Testing to verify that the change does not adversely impact system security. For bespoke and custom software changes, all updates are tested for compliance withRequirement 6.2.4 before being deployed intoproduction. Procedures to address failures and return to a secure state. 6.5.1.a Examine documented change controlprocedures to verify procedures are defined for changes to all system components in the production environment to include all elementsspecified in this requirement.6.5.1.b Examine recent changes to systemcomponents and trace those changes back to related change control documentation. For eachchange examined, verify the change is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll changes are tracked, authorized, and evaluated for impact and security, and changes are managed to avoid unintended effects to the security of system components.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHaving processes to analyze significant changeshelps ensure that all appropriate PCI DSS controls are applied to any systems or networks added or changed within the in- scope environment, and thatPCI DSS requirements continue to be met to secure the envir onment.Good PracticeBuilding this validation into change management processes helps ensure that device inventories and configuration standards are kept up to date and security controls are applied where needed.ExamplesApplicable PCI DSS requirements that could beimpacted include, but are not limited to: Network and data-flow diagrams are updated toreflect changes. Systems are configured per configurationstandards, with all default passwords changed and unnecessary services disabled. Systems are protected with required controls -forexample, file integrity monitoring (FIM), anti -malware, patches, and audit logging. Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and all account data storage is documented andincorporated into data retention policy and procedures. New systems are included in the quarterly vulnerability scanning process. Systems are scanned for internal and external vulnerabilities after significant changes per Requirements 11.3.1.3 and 11.3.2.1. 6.5.2 Upon completion of a significant change, allapplicable PCI DSS requirements are confirmed tobe in place on all new or changed systems and networks, and documentation is updated as applicable. 6.5.2 Examine documentation for significantchanges, interview personnel, and observe the affected systems networks to verify that the entity confirmed applicable PCI DSS requirements were in place on all new or changed systems and networks and that documentation was updated asapplicable.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll system components are verified after asignificant change to be compliant with the applicable PCI DSS requirements.Applicability NotesThese significant changes should also be captured and reflected in the entity's annual PCI DSS scope confirmation activity per Requirement 12.5.2.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDue to the constantly changing state of pre-production environments, they are often less secure than the production environment.Good PracticeOrganizations must clearly understand which environments are test environments or developmentenvironments and how these environments interacton the level of networks and applications .DefinitionsPre-production environments include development, testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. Even where production infrastructure is used to facilitate testing or development, production environments stillneed to be separated (logically or physically) fr ompre-production functionality such that vulnerabilitiesintroduced as a result of pre- production activities donot adversely affect production systems. 6.5.3 Pre-production environments are separatedfrom production environments and the separation is enforced with access controls. 6.5.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for separating the pre-production environment from the production environment via access controls that enforce the separation.6.5.3.b Examine network documentation andconfigurations of network security controls to verify that the pre-production environment is separate from the production environment(s).6.5.3.c Examine access control settings to verifythat access controls are in place to enforce separation between the pre-production and production environment(s).Customized Approach ObjectivePre-production environments cannot introduce risksand vulnerabilities into production environments.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe goal of separating roles and functions betweenproduction and pre -production environments is toreduce the number of personnel with access to the production environment and account data andthereby minimize risk of unauthorized, unintentional, or inappropriate access to data and systemcomponents and help ensure that access is limited tothose individuals with a business need for such access.The intent of this control is to separate critical activities to provide oversight and review to catch errors and minimize the chances of fraud or theft (since two people would need to collude in order tohide an activity).Separating roles and functions, also referred to asseparation or segregation of duties, is a key internal control concept to protect an entity's assets. 6.5.4 Roles and functions are separated betweenproduction and pre -production environments toprovide accountability such that only reviewed and approved changes are deployed. 6.5.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for separating roles and functions to provide accountability such that only reviewed and approved changes are deployed.6.5.4.b Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify implemented controls separate roles and functions and provide accountability such that only reviewed and approved changes are deployed.Customized Approach ObjectiveJob roles and accountability that differentiate between pre-production and production activitiesare defined and managed to minimize the risk ofunauthorized, unintentional, or inappropriate actions.Applicability NotesIn environments with limited personnel whereindividuals perform multiple roles or functions, thissame goal can be achieved with additional procedural controls that provide accountability. For example, a developer may also be an administrator that uses an administrator -level account withelevated privileges in the development environment and, for their developer role, they use a separateaccount with user -level access to the productionenvironment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUse of live PANs outside of protected CDEs providesmalicious individuals with the opportunity to gain unauthorized access to cardholder data.DefinitionsLive PANs refer to valid PANs (not test PANs) issued by, or on behalf of, a payment brand. Additionally,when payment cards expire, the same PAN is oftenreused with a different expiry date. All PANs must be verified as being unable to conduct payment transactions or pose fraud risk to the paymentsystem before they are excluded from PCI DSSscope. It is the responsibility of the entity to confirm that PANs are not live. 6.5.5 Live PANs are not used in pre-productionenvironments, except where those environments are included in the CDE and protected in accordance with all applicable PCI DSS requirements. 6.5.5.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for not using live PANs in pre- production environments, except wherethose environments are in a CDE and protected in accordance with all applicable PCI DSS requirements.6.5.5.b Observe testing processes and interviewpersonnel to verify procedures are in place to ensure live PANs are not used in pre-production environments, except where those environmentsare in a CDE and protected in accordance with allapplicable PCI DSS requirements.6.5.5.c Examine pre-production test data to verifylive PANs are not used in pre- productionenvironments, except where those environments are in a CDE and protected in accordance with all applicable PCI DSS requirements. Customized Approach ObjectiveLive PANs cannot be present in pre-production environments outside the CDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThis data may give away information about thefunctioning of an application or system and is an easy target for unauthorized individuals to exploit to gain access to systems. Possession of such information could facilitate compromise of the system and related account data. 6.5.6 Test data and test accounts are removed fromsystem components before the system goes into production. 6.5.6.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for removal of test data and test accounts from system components before the system goes into production.6.5.6.b Observe testing processes for both off -the-shelf software and in-house applications , andinterview personnel to verify test data and test accounts are removed before a system goes into production.6.5.6.c Examine data and accounts for recentlyinstalled or updated off -the-shelf software and in-house applications to verify there is no test data or test accounts on systems in production. Customized Approach ObjectiveTest data and test accounts cannot exist inproduction environments.Implement Strong Access Control MeasuresRequirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to KnowSections7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined andunderstood.7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).OverviewUnauthorized individuals may gain access to critical data or systems due to ineffective access control rules and definitions. To ensure criticaldata can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know andaccording to job responsibilities.Access or access rights are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications , and data, while privileges allow a user toperform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data, but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user's assigned privileges.Need to know refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job.Least privileges refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job.These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and otherthird parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements also apply to application and system accountsused by the entity (also called service accounts).These requirements do not apply to consumers (cardholders).Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined andunderstood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 7.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 7. While it is important to define the specific policiesor procedures called out in Requirement 7, it isequally important to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For thisreason, consider updating these documents assoon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that arefollowed to achieve the desired result in aconsistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 7.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 7 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 7.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 7 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 7 are defined andadhered to by affected personnel. All supportingactivities are repeatable, consistently applied, andconform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintainedwithin separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 7.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 7 are documented, assigned, and understood. 7.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 7 are documented and assigned.7.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 7 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 7 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDefining an access control model that isappropriate for the entity's technology and access control philosophy supports a consistent anduniform way of allocating access and reduces thepossibility of errors such as the granting of excessive rights.Good PracticeA factor to consider when defining access needs is the separation of duties principle. This principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft ofresources. For example, 1) dividing mission -critical functions and information system supportfunctions among different individuals and or functions, 2) establishing roles such thatinformation system support activities are performed by different functions individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance andtesting, and network security), and 3) ensuringsecurity personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.In environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to -end control ofa process without an independent checkpoint. For example, respon sibility for configuration andresponsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals.(continued on next page) 7.2.1 An access control model is defined andincludes granting access as follows: Appropriate access depending on the entity's business and access needs. Access to system components and data resources that is based on users' job classification and functions. The least privileges required (for example, user, administrator) to perform a job function. 7.2.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures and interview personnel to verify the access control model is defined in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.1.b Examine access control model settings andverify that access needs are appropriately defined in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess requirements are established according tojob functions following least -privilege and need- to-know principles.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance7.1.2 (continued) DefinitionsKey elements of an access control model include: Resources to be protected (thesystems devices data to which access is needed), Job functions that need access to the resource (for example, system administrator,call-center personnel, store clerk), and Which activities each job function needs toperform (for example, read write or query).Once job functions, resources, and activities per job functions are defined, individuals can be granted access accordingly.ExamplesAccess control models that ent ities can considerinclude role-based access control (RBAC) andattribute -based access control (ABAC). Theaccess control model used by a given entitydepends on their business and access needs.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAssigning least privileges helps prevent userswithout sufficient knowledge about the application from incorrectly or accidentally changing application configuration or altering its security settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorizedperson gains access to a user ID.Good PracticeAccess rights are granted to a user byassignment to one or several functions. A ccess isassigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job.When assigning privileged access, it is importantto assign individuals only the privileges they needto perform their job (the least privileges). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator.Once needs are defined for user functions (per PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their jobclassification and function by using the already -created roles.Entities may wish to consider use of PrivilegedAccess Management (PAM), which is a method to grant access to privileged accounts only whenthose privileges are required, immediately revoking that access once they are no longerneeded. 7.2.2 Access is assigned to users, includingprivileged users, based on: Job classification and function. Least privileges necessary to perform job responsibilities. 7.2.2.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythey cover assigning access to users in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.2.b Examine user access settings, including forprivileged users, and interview responsible management personnel to verify that privileges assigned are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.2.c Interview personnel responsible forassigning access to verify that privileged user access is assigned in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess to systems and data is limited to only theaccess needed to perform job functions, as definedin the related access roles.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDocumented approval (for example, in writing orelectronically) assures that those with access and privileges are known and authorized by management, and that their access is necessary for their job function. 7.2.3 Required privileges are approved byauthorized personnel. 7.2.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythey define processes for approval of all privileges by authorized personnel.7.2.3.b Examine user IDs and assigned privileges,and compare with documented approvals to verify that: Documented approval exists for the assigned privileges. The approval was by authorized personnel. Specified privileges match the roles assignedto the individual. Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess privileges cannot be granted to userswithout appropriate, documented authorization.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegular review of access rights helps to detectexcessive access rights remaining after user jobresponsibilities change, system functions change, or other modifications. If excessive user rights are not revoked in due time, they may be used by malicious users for unauthorized access.This review provides another opportunity to ensure that accounts for all terminated users havebeen removed (if any were missed at the time oftermination), as well as to ensure that any third parties that no longer need access have had their access termin ated.Good PracticeWhen a user transfers into a new role or a new department, typically the privileges and access associated with their former role are no longer required. Continued access to privileges or functions that are no longer required mayintroduce the risk of misus e or errors. Therefore,when responsibilities change, processes thatrevalidate access help to ensure user access is appropriate for the user's new responsibilities.Entities can consider implementing a regular,repeatable process for conducting reviews of access rights, and assigning data owners that are responsible for managing and monitoringaccess to data related to their job function andthat also ensure user access remains current and appropriate. As an example, a direct manager could review team access monthly, while the senior manager reviews their groups' access quarterly, both making updates to access as needed. The intent of these best practices is tosupport and facilitate conducting the reviews atleast once every 6 months. 7.2.4 All user accounts and related accessprivileges, including third-party vendor accounts, are reviewed as follows: At least once every six months . To ensure user accounts and access remainappropriate based on job function. Any inappropriate access is addressed. Management acknowledges that access remains appropriate. 7.2.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythey define processes to review all user accounts and related access privileges, including third-party vendor accounts, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.4.b Interview responsible personnel andexamine documented results of periodic reviews of user accounts to verify that all the results are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccount privilege assignments are verifiedperiodically by management as correct, and nonconformities are remediated.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to all user accounts andrelated access privileges , including those used bypersonnel and third parties vendors, and accounts used to access third-party cloud services.See Requirements 7.2.5 and 7.2.5.1 and 8.6.1through 8.6.3 for controls for application and systemaccounts .This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important to establish the appropriate accesslevel for application or system accounts. If such accounts are compromised, malicious users will receive the same access level as that granted to the application or system. Therefore, it is important to ensure limited access is granted tosystem and application accounts on the samebasis as to user accounts.Good PracticeEntities may want to consider establishing a baseline when setting up these application and system accounts including the following as applicable to the organization: Making sure that the account is not a member of a privileged group such as domain administrators, local administrators, or root . Restricting which computers the account can be used on. Restricting hours of use. Removing any additional settings like VPN access and remote access. 7.2.5 All application and system accounts andrelated access privileges are assigned and managed as follows: Based on the least privileges necessary for the operability of the system or application. Access is limited to the systems, applications, orprocesses that specifically require their use. 7.2.5.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythey define processes to manage and assignapplication and system accounts and related access privileges in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.5.b Examine privileges associated with systemand application accounts and interview responsible personnel to verify that application and system accounts and related access privileges are assigned and managed in accordance with allelements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess rights granted to application and systemaccounts are limited to only the access needed forthe operability of that application or system.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegular review of access rights helps to detectexcessive access rights remaining after system functions change, or other application or system modifications occur. If excessive rights are not removed when no longer needed, they may be used by malicious users for unauthorized access. 7.2.5.1 All access by application and systemaccounts and related access privileges are reviewedas follows: Periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified inRequirement 12.3.1). The application system access remainsappropriate for the function being performed. Any inappropriate access is addressed. Management acknowledges that accessremains appropriate. 7.2.5.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythey define processes to review all application and system accounts and related access privileges in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.5.1.b Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of periodic reviews of application and system accounts and related access privileges to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elementsspecified in Requirement 12.3.1.7.2.5.1.c Interview responsible personnel andexamine documented results of periodic reviews ofsystem and application accounts and relatedprivileges to verify that the reviews occur inaccordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveApplication and system account privilege assignments are verified periodically by management as correct, and nonconformities are remediated.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe misuse of query access to repositories ofcardholder data has been a regular cause of data breaches. Limiting such access to administrators reduces the risk of such access being abused by unauthorized users.DefinitionsProgrammatic methods means granting access through means such as database stored procedures that allow users to perform controlled actions to data in a table, rather than via direct, unfiltered access to the data repository by end users (except for the responsible administrator(s), who need direct access to the database for theiradministrative duties).Good PracticeTypical user actions include moving, copying, anddeleting data. Also consider the scope of privilege needed when granting access. For example, access can be granted to specific objects such as data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and stored routines. Granting access to repositories ofcardholder data should follow the same processas all other granted access, meaning that it is based on roles, with only the privileges assigned to each user that are needed to perform their job functions. 7.2.6 All user access to query repositories of storedcardholder data is restricted as follows: Via applications or other programmatic methods,with access and allowed actions based on user roles and least privileges. Only the responsible administrator(s) candirectly access or query repositories of storedCHD. 7.2.6.a Examine policies and procedures andinterview personnel to verify processes are defined for granting user access to query repositories of stored cardholder data, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for queryingrepositories of stored cardholder data to verify they are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveDirect unfiltered (ad hoc) query access tocardholder data repositories is prohibited, unless performed by an authorized administrator.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to controls for user accessto query repositories of stored cardholder data.See Requirements 7.2.5 and 7.2.5.1 and 8.6.1 through 8.6.3 for controls for application and system accounts .Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout a mechanism to restrict access based onuser's need to know, a user may unknowingly be granted access to cardholder data. Access controlsystems automate the process of restrictingaccess and assigning privileges. 7.3.1 An access control system(s) is in place thatrestricts access based on a user's need to know and covers all system components. 7.3.1 Examine vendor documentation and systemsettings to verify that access is managed for each system component via an access control system(s) that restricts access based on a user's need toknow and covers all system components.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess rights and privileges are managed viamechanisms intended for that purpose.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRestricting privileged access with an accesscontrol system reduces the opportunity for error sin the assignment of permissions to individuals,applications, and systems . 7.3.2 The access control system(s) is configured toenforce permissions assigned to individuals,applications , and systems based on jobclassification and function. 7.3.2 Examine vendor documentation and systemsettings to verify that the access control system(s) is configured to enforce permissions assigned toindividuals, applications, and systems based on job classification and function.Customized Approach ObjectiveIndividual account access rights and privileges tosystems, applications, and data are only inherited from group membership.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA default setting of deny all ensures no one isgranted access unless a rule is establishedspecifically granting such access.Good PracticeIt is important to check the default configuration of access control systems because some are set bydefault to allow all, thereby permitting accessunless until a rule is written to specifically deny it. 7.3.3 The access control system(s) is set to denyall by default. 7.3.3 Examine vendor documentation and systemsettings to verify that the access control system(s)is set to deny all by default.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess rights and privileges are prohibited unless expressly permitted.Requirement 8: Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System ComponentsSections8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account's lifecycle.8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.8.4 Multi -factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE .8.5 Multi -factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.OverviewTwo fundamental principles of identifying and authenticating users are to 1) establish the identity of an individual or process on a computersystem, and 2) prove or verify the user associated with the identity is who the user claims to be.Identification of an individual or process on a computer system is conducted by associating an identity with a person or process through anidentifier, such as a user, system, or application ID. These IDs (also referred to as accounts) fundamentally establish the identity of an individualor process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each user orprocess can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place,actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes.The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such asa password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric element.The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privilegesassociated with a user, application, system, or service accounts.These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry -accepted security principles and best practices to support the paymentecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800- 63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digitalidentity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and shouldbe viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and not asstandalone parameters.Note : Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components , unless specificallycalled out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to: Point -of-sale accounts Accounts with administrative capabilities System and application accounts All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data.This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, forproviding support or maintenance services).Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts on point -of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time tofacilitate a single transaction. When items do not apply, they are noted directly within the specific requirement.These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (cardholders).Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 8.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies andprocedures specified throughout Requirement 8.While it is important to define the specific policiesor procedures called out in Requirement 8, it isequally important to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For thisreason, consider updating these documents assoon as possible after a change occurs and notonly on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's securityobjectives and principles. Operational proceduresdescribe how to perform activities, and define thecontrols, methods, and processes that arefollowed to achieve the desired result in aconsistent manner and in accordance with policyobjectives. 8.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 8 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties. 8.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies andoperational procedures that are identified inRequirement 8 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 8 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, andconform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintainedwithin separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 8.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 8 are documented, assigned, and understood. 8.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 8 are documented and assigned.8.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 8 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 8 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuousoperation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account's lifecycle.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe ability to trace actions performed on acomputer system to an individual establishes accountability and traceability and is fundamentalto establishing effective access controls.By ensuring each user is uniquely identified,instead of using one ID for several employees, an organization can maintain individual responsibility for actions and an effective record in the audit log per employee. In addition, this will assist with issue resolution and containment when misuse ormalicious intent occurs. 8.2.1 All users are assigned a unique ID beforeaccess to system components or cardholder data isallowed. 8.2.1.a Interview responsible personnel to verifythat all users are assigned a unique ID for access to system components and cardholder data.8.2.1.b Examine audit logs and other evidence toverify that access to system components andcardholder data can be uniquely identified andassociated with individuals. Customized Approach ObjectiveAll actions by all users are attributable to anindividual.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts within point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transactionRequirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeGroup, shared, or generic (or default) IDs aretypically delivered with software or operatingsystems-for example, root or with privileges associated with a specific function, such as an administrator.If multiple users share the same authenticationcredentials (for example, user ID and password),it becomes impossible to trace system accessand activities to an individual. In turn, this prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective logging of, an individual's actions since a given action could have been performed by anyone in the group with knowledgeof the user ID and associated authenticationfactors .The ability to associate individuals to the actions performed with an ID is essential to provideindividual accountability and traceability regarding who performed an action, what action was performed, and when that action occurred.Good PracticeIf shared IDs are used for any reason, strongmanagement controls need to be established tomaintain individual accountability and traceability.(continued on next page) 8.2.2 Group, shared, or generic IDs , or other sharedauthentication credentials are only used whennecessary on an exception basis, and are managedas follows: ID use is prevented unless needed for anexceptional circumstance. Use is limited to the time needed for theexceptional circumstance. Business justification for use is documented. Use is explicitly approved by management. Individual user identity is confirmed beforeaccess to an account is granted. Every action taken is attributable to an individualuser. 8.2.2.a Examine user account lists on systemcomponents and applicable documentation to verify that shared authentication credentials are only used when necessary, on an exception basis, and are managed in accordance with all elementsspecified in this requirement.8.2.2.b Examine authentication policies andprocedures to verify processes are defined forshared authentication credentials such that theyare only used when necessary, on an exceptionbasis, and are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requ irement.8.2.2.c Interview system administrators to verifythat shared authentication credentials are only used when necessary, on an exception basis, andare managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll actions performed by users with group, shared, or generic IDs are attributable to an individualperson.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts within point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.2.2 (continued) ExamplesTools and techniques can facilitate bothmanagement and security of these types of accounts and confirm individual user identity before access to an account is granted. Entities can consider password vaults or other system -managed controls such as the sudo command.An example of an exceptional circumstance is where all other authentication methods have failed, and a shared ID is needed for emergencyuse or break the glass administrator access.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeService providers with remote access to customer premises typically use this access to support POS POI systems or provide other remote services.If a service provider uses the same authenticationfactors to access multiple customers, all theservice provider's customers can easily becompromised if an attacker compromises that onefactor.Criminals know this and deliberately target service providers looking for a shared authentication factor that gives them remote access to many merchants via that single factor.(continued on next page) 8.2.3 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Service providers with remoteaccess to customer premises use unique authentication factors for each customer premises. 8.2.3 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Examineauthentication policies and procedures and interview personnel to verify that service providers with remote access to customer premises useunique authentication factors for remote access toeach customer premises.Customized Approach ObjectiveA service provider's credential used for one customer cannot be used for any other customer.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes ExamplesTechnologies such as multi -factor mechanismsthat provide a unique credential for eachconnection ( such as a single -use password) couldalso meet the intent of this requirement. This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.This requirement is not intended to apply to service providers accessing their own shared services environments, where multiple customerenvironments are hosted.If service provider employees use sharedauthentication factors to remotely access customer premises, these factors must be unique per customer and managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is imperative that the lifecycle of a user ID(additions, deletions, and modifications) is controlled so that only authorized accounts canperform functions, actions are auditable, and privileges are limited to only what is required.Attackers often compromise an existing accountand then escalate the privileges of that account toperform unauthorized acts, or they may create new IDs to continue their activity in the background. It is essential to detect and respond when user IDs are created or changed outside thenormal change process or without corresponding authorization. 8.2.4 Addition, deletion, and modification of userIDs, authentication factors, and other identifierobjects are managed as follows: Authorized with the appropriate approval. Implemented with only the privileges specifiedon the documented approval. 8.2.4 Examine documented authorizations acrossvarious phases of the account lifecycle (additions,modifications, and deletions) and examine systemsettings to verify the activity has been managed in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveLifecycle events for user IDs and authentication factors cannot occur without appropriateauthorization.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to all user accounts, including employees, contractors, consultants,temporary workers , and third- party vendors.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf an employee or third party vendor has left the company and still has access to the network via their user account , unnecessary or maliciousaccess to cardholder data could occur -either bythe former employee or by a malicious user who exploits the old and or unused account. 8.2.5 Access for terminated users is immediatelyrevoked. 8.2.5.a Examine information sources for terminatedusers and review current user access lists -forboth local and remote access -to verify thatterminated user IDs have been deactivated or removed from the access lists.8.2.5.b Interview responsible personnel to v erifythat all physical authentication factors -such as,smart cards, tokens, etc. -have been returned ordeactivated for terminated users . Customized Approach ObjectiveThe accounts of terminated users cannot be used.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAccounts that are not used regularly are oftentargets of attack since it is less likely that any changes, such as a changed password, will be noticed. As such, these accounts may be more easily exploited and used to access cardholder data.Good PracticeWhere it may be reasonably anticipated that an account will not be used for an extended period of time, such as an extended leave of absence, the account should be disabled as soon as the leave begins, rather than waiting 90 days. 8.2.6 Inactive user accounts are removed ordisabled within 90 days of inactivity. 8.2.6 Examine user accounts and last logoninformation, and interview personnel to verify that any inactive user accounts are removed ordisabled within 90 days of inactivity.Customized Approach ObjectiveInactive user accounts cannot be used.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAllowing third parties to have 24 7 access into an entity's systems and networks in case they need to provide support increases the chances of unauthorized access . This access could result inan unauthorized user in the third party 'senvironment or a malicious individual using the always -available external entry point into anentity's network. Where third parties do need access 24 7, it should be documented, justified, monitored, and tied to specific service reasons.(continued on next page) 8.2.7 Accounts used by third parties to access,support, or maintain system components via remote access are managed as follows: Enabled only during the time period needed and disabled when not in use. Use is monitored for unexpected activity. 8.2.7 Interview personnel, examine documentationfor managing accounts, and examine evidence to verify that accounts used by third parties for remote access are managed according to all elements specified in this requirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective Good PracticeEnabling access only for the time periods neededand disabling it as soon as it is no longer required helps prevent misuse of these connections. Additionally, consider assigning third parties a start and stop date for their access in accordance with their service contract.Monitoring third-party access helps ensure that third parties are accessing only the systems necessary and only during approved time frames. Any unusual activity using third-party accounts should be followed up and resolved. Third-party remote access cannot be used exceptwhere specifically authorized and use is overseen by management.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWhen users walk away from an open machinewith access to system components or cardholderdata, there is a risk that the machine may be used by others in the user's absence, resulting in unauthorized account access and or misuse.Good PracticeThe re- authentication can be applied either at thesystem level to protect all sessions running on that machine or at the application level.Entities may also want to consider staging controls in succession to further restrict the access of an unattended session as time passes. For example, the screensaver may activate after15 minutes and log off the user after an hour.However, timeout controls must balance the riskof access and exposure with the impact to the user and purpose of the access .If a user needs to run a program from an unattended computer, the user can log in to the computer to initiate the program, and then lock the computer so that no one else can use theuser's login while the computer is unattended.ExamplesOne way to meet this requirement is to configurean automated screensaver to launch whenever the console is idle for 15 minutes and requiring the logged-in user to enter their password to unlock the screen. 8.2.8 If a user session has been idle for more than15 minutes, the user is required to re- authenticate tore-activate the terminal or session. 8.2.8 Examine system configuration settings toverify that system session idle timeout features for user sessions have been set to 15 minutes or less.Customized Approach ObjectiveA user session cannot be used except by the authorized user.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.This requirement is not meant to prevent legitimateactivities from being performed while the console PC is unattended.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWhen used in addition to unique IDs, anauthentication factor helps protect user IDs from being compromised, since the attacker needs tohave the unique ID and compromise theassociated authentication factor(s).Good PracticeA common approach for a malicious individual to compromise a system is to exploit weak or nonexistent authentication factors (for example, passwords passphrases). Requiring strongauthentication factors helps protect against thisattack.Further InformationSee fidoalliance.org for more information aboutusing tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. 8.3.1 All user access to system components forusers and administrators is authenticated via atleast one of the following authentication factors : Something you know, such as a password orpassphrase. Something you have, such as a token device or smart card. Something you are, such as a biometric element. 8.3.1.a Examine documentation describing theauthentication factor(s) used to verify that useraccess to system components is authenticated viaat least one authentication factor specified in this requirement.8.3.1.b For each type of authentication factor usedwith each type of system component, observe an authentication to verify that authentication is functioning consistently with documented authentication factor(s).Customized Approach ObjectiveAn account cannot be accessed except with acombination of user identity and an authentication factor.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.This requirement does not supersede multi -factorauthentication ( MFA ) requirements but applies tothose in- scope systems not otherwise subject toMFA requirements.A digital certificate is a valid option for something you have if it is unique for a particular user.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeNetwork devices and applications have beenknown to transmit unencrypted, readableauthentication factors (such as passwords and passphrases) across the network and or store these values without encryption. As a result, a malicious individual can easily intercept thisinformation during transmission using a sniffer,or directly access unencrypted authentication factors in files where they are stored, and then use this data to gain unauthorized access. 8.3.2 Strong cryptography is used to render allauthentication factors unreadable duringtransmission and storage on all system components. 8.3.2.a Examine vendor documentation andsystem configuration settings to verify that authentication factors are rendered unreadable with strong cryptography during transmission and storage.8.3.2.b Examine repositories of authenticationfactors to verify that they are unreadable during storage.8.3.2.c Examine data transmissions to verify thatauthentication factors are unreadable during transmission.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext authentication factors cannot be obtained, derived, or reused from the interception of communications or from stored data.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMalicious individuals use social engineeringtechniques to impersonate a user of a system -for example, calling a help desk and acting as a legitimate user -to have an authentication factorchanged so they can use a valid user ID.Requiring positive identification of a user reducesthe probability of this type of attack succeeding.Good PracticeModifications to authentication factors for whichuser identity should be verified include but are not limited to performing password resets, provisioning new hardware or software tokens, and generating new keys.ExamplesMethods to verify a user's identit y include a secretquestion answer, knowledge -based information,and calling the user back at a known and previously established phone number. 8.3.3 User identity is verified before modifying anyauthentication factor . 8.3.3 Examine procedures for modifyingauthentication factors and observe security personnel to verify that when a user requests a modification of an authentication factor, the user's identity is verified before the authentication factoris modified.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized individuals cannot gain system accessby impersonating the identity of an authorized user.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout account -lockout mechanisms in place, anattacker can continually try to guess a passwordthrough manual or automated tools (for example, password cracking) until the attacker succeeds and gains access to a user's account.If an account is locked out due to someonecontinually trying to guess a password, controls todelay reactivation of the locked account stop the malicious individual from guessing the password, as they will have to stop for a minimum of 30 minutes until the account is reactivated.Good PracticeBefore reactivating a locked account, the user'sidenti ty should be confirm ed. For example, theadministrator or help desk personnel can validatethat the actual account owner is requesting reactivation, or there may be password reset self -service mechanisms that the account owner uses to verify their identity. 8.3.4 Invalid authentication attempts are limited by: Locking out the user ID after not more than 10 attempts. Setting the lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until the user's identity is confirmed. 8.3.4.a Examine system configuration settings toverify that authentication parameters are set to require that user accounts be locked out after notmore than 10 invalid logon attempts.8.3.4.b Examine system configuration settings toverify that password parameters are set to require that once a user account is locked out, it remains locked for a minimum of 30 minutes or until the user's identity is confirmed.Customized Approach ObjectiveAn authentication factor cannot be guessed in abrute force, online attack.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time tofacilitate a single transaction .Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf the same password passphrase is used for every new user, an internal user, former employee, or malicious individual may know or easily discover the value and use it to gain accessto accounts before the authorized user attemptsto use the password. 8.3.5 If passwords passphrases are used asauthentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,they are set and reset for each user as follows: Set to a unique value for first -time use and uponreset. Forced to be changed immediately after the firstuse. 8.3.5 Examine procedures for setting and resettingpasswords passphrases (if used as authentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1) and observesecurity personnel to verify thatpasswords passphrases are set and reset inaccordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAn initial or reset password passphrase assigned to a user cannot be used by an unauthorized user.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeStrong passwords passphrases may be the firstline of defense into a network since a malicious individual will often first try to find accounts withweak, static, or non-existent passwords. If passwords are short or easily guessable, it is relatively easy for a malicious individual to findthese weak accounts and compromise a networkunder the guise of a valid user ID.Good PracticePassword passphrase strength is dependent on password passphrase complexity, length, and randomness. Passwords passphrases should be sufficiently complex, so they are impractical for anattacker to guess or otherwise discover its value.Entities can consider adding increased complexity by requiring the use of special characters and upper - and lower -case characters, in addition tothe minimum standards outlined by this requirement . Additional complexity increases thetime required for offline brute force att acks ofhashed passwords passphrases.Another option for increasing the resistance of passwords to guessing attacks is by comparing proposed password passphrases to a bad password list and having users provide new passwords for any passwords found on the list. 8.3.6 If passwords passphrases are used asauthentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,they meet the following minimum level of complexity: A minimum length of 12 characters (or IF thesystem does not support 12 characters, aminimum length of eight characters). Contain both numeric and alphabetic characters. 8.3.6 Examine system configuration settings toverify that user password passphrase complexity parameters are set in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveA guessed password passphrase cannot be verified by either an online or offline brute force attack.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to: User accounts on point -of-sale terminals thathave access to only one card number at a timeto facilitate a single transaction. Application or system accounts, which are governed by requirements in section 8.6.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Until 31 March 2025, passwords must be aminimum length of seven characters in accordancewith PCI DSS v3.2.1 Requirement 8.2.3.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf password history is not maintained, theeffectiveness of changing passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a period reduces the likelihood that passwordsthat have been guessed or brute-forced will be re-used in the future.Passwords or passphrases may have previouslybeen changed due to suspicion of compromise or because the password or passphrase exceeded its effective use period, both of which are reasons why previously used passwords should not be reused. 8.3.7 Individuals are not allowed to submit a newpassword passphrase that is the same as any of the last four passwords passphrases used. 8.3.7 Examine system configuration settings toverify that password parameters are set to require that new passwords passphrases cannot be the same as the four previously used passwords passphrases.Customized Approach ObjectiveA previously used password cannot be used to gain access to an account for at least 12 months.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to useraccounts on point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCommunicating authentication policies andprocedures to all users helps them to understand and abide by the policies.Good PracticeGuidance on selecting strong passwords may include suggestions to help personnel selecthard-to -guess passwords that do not containdictionary words or information about the user,such as the user ID, names of family members, date of birth, etc.Guidance for protecting authentication factors may include not writing down passwords or not saving them in insecure files, and being alert tomalicious individuals who may try to exploit theirpasswords (for example, by calling an employeeand asking for their password so the caller can troubleshoot a problem).Alternatively, entities can implement processes toconfirm passwords meet password policy, for example, by comparing password choices to a list of unacceptable passwords and having userschoose a new password for any that match withone on the list. Instructing users to change passwords if there is a chance the password is no longer secure can prevent malicious users from using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized access. 8.3.8 Authentication policies and procedures aredocumented and communicated to all users including: Guidance on selecting strong authenticationfactors . Guidance for how users should protect their authentication factors. Instructions not to reuse previously used passwords passphrases. Instructions to change passwords passphrases if there is any suspicion or knowledge that the password passphrases have been compromised and how to report the incident. 8.3.8.a Examine procedures and interviewpersonnel to verify that authentication policies and procedures are distributed to all users.8.3.8.b Review authentication policies andprocedures that are distributed to users and verify they include the elements specified in this requirement.8.3.8.c Interview users to verify that they arefamiliar with authentication policies and procedures.Customized Approach ObjectiveUsers are knowledgeable about the correct use of authentication factors and can access assistanceand guidance when required.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAccess to in -scope system components that arenot in the CDE may be provided using a singleauthentication factor, such as a password passphrase, token device or smart card, or biometric attribute. Where passwords passphrases are employed as the onlyauthentication factor for such access, additionalcontrols are required to protect the integrity of the password passphrase.Good PracticePasswords passphrases that are valid for a long time without a change provide malicious individuals with more time to break thepassword phrase. Periodically changingpasswords offers less time for a malicious individual to crack a password passphrase and less time to use a compromised password.Using a password passphrase as the only authentication factor provides a single point of failure if compromised. Therefore, in these implementations, controls are needed to minimizehow long malicious activity could occur via acompromised password passphr ase.(continued on next page) 8.3.9 If passwords passphrases are used as theonly authentication factor for user access (i.e., inany single-factor authentication implementation)then either: Passwords passphrases are changed at leastonce every 90 days,OR The security posture of accounts is dynamicallyanalyzed, and real -time access to resources isautomatically determined accordingly. 8.3.9 If passwords passphrases are used as theonly authentication factor for user access, inspectsystem configuration settings to verify that passwords passphrases are managed in accordance with ONE of the elements specified inthis requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAn undetected compromised password passphrasecannot be used indefinitely.Applicability NotesThis requirement does not apply to in -scope systemcomponents where MFA is used.This requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point -of-sale terminals that haveaccess to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.This requirement does not apply to serviceproviders' customer accounts but does apply toaccounts for service provider personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.3.9 (continued) Dynamically analyzing an account's securityposture is another option that allows for more rapid detection and response to address potentially compromised credentials. Such analysis takes a number of data points, which may include device integrity, locatio n, accesstimes, and the resources accessed to determinein real time whether an account can be grantedaccess to a requested resource. In this way, access can be denied and accounts blocked if it is suspected that authentication credentials have been compromised.Further InformationFor information about using dynamic analysis tomanage user access to resources, see NIST SP800-207 Zero Trust Architecture.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUsing a password passphrase as the onlyauthentication factor provides a single point of failure if compromised.

Periodically changing passwords offers less time for a malicious individual to crack a password passphrase andless time to use a compromised password. 8.3.10 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: If passwords passphrases areused as the only authentication factor for customeruser access to cardholder data (i.e., in any single-factor authentication implementation), thenguidance is provided to customer users including: Guidance for customers to change their userpasswords passphrases periodically. Guidance as to when, and under what circumstances, passwords passphrases are to be changed. 8.3.10 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Ifpasswords passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for customer user access to cardholder data, examine guidance provided tocustomer users to verify that the guidance includesall elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectivePasswords passphrases for service providers' customers cannot be used indefinitely.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.This requirement does not apply to accounts ofconsumer users accessing their own payment cardinformation.This requirement for service providers will besuperseded by Requirement 8.3.10.1 once 8.3.10.1becomes effective.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUsing a password passphrase as the onlyauthentication factor provides a single point of failure if compromised.

Physical and or logical controls ensure only the intended user can use that factor to gain access. 8.3.11.a Examine authentication policies andprocedures to verify that procedures for using authentication factors such as physical security tokens, smart cards, and certificates are defined and include all elements specified in thisrequirement.8.3.11.b Interview security personnel to verifyauthentication factors are assigned to an individualuser and not shared among multiple users.8.3.11.c Examine system configuration settingsand or observe physical controls, as applicable, toverify that controls are implemented to ensure onlythe intended user can use that factor to gainaccess. Customized Approach ObjectiveAn authentication factor cannot be used by anyoneother than the user to which it is assigned.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.4 Multi -factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequiring more than one type of authenticationfactor reduces the probability that an attacker can gain access to a system by masquerading as alegitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. This is especially true in environments where traditionally the single authentication factor employed was something a user knows such as a password or passphrase.Good PracticeImplementing MFA for non- console administrativeaccess to in-scope system components that are not part of the CDE will help prevent unauthorizedusers from using a single factor to gain accessand compromise in- scope system components .DefinitionsUsing one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi -factor authentication. 8.4.1 MFA is implemented for all non-consoleaccess into the CDE for personnel withadministrative access . 8.4.1.a Examine network and or systemconfigurations to verify MFA is required for all non-console into the CDE for personnel withadministrative access.8.4.1.b Observe administrator personnel logginginto the CDE and verify that MFA is required.Customized Approach ObjectiveAdministrative access to the CDE cannot be obtained by the use of a single authentication factor .Applicability NotesThe requirement for MFA for non-consoleadministrative access applies to all personnel withelevated or increased privileges accessing the CDE via a non-console connection -that is, via logicalaccess occurring over a network interface rather than via a direct, physical connection.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequiring more than one type of authenticationfactor reduces the probability that an attacker can gain access to a system by masquerading as a legitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. This is especially true in environments wheretraditionally the single authentication factoremployed was something a user knows such as a password or passphras e.(continued on next page) 8.4.2 MFA is implemented for all non-consoleaccess into the CDE. 8.4.2.a Examine network and or systemconfigurations to verify MFA is implemented for all non-console access into the CDE.8.4.2.b Observe personnel logging in to the CDEand examine evidence to verify that MFA is required.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess into the CDE cannot be obtained by the useof a single authentication factor.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes DefinitionsUsing one factor twice (for example, using twoseparate passwords) is not considered multi -factor authentication.Refer to Appendix G for the definition of phishingresistant authentication. This requirement does not apply to: Application or system accounts performingautomated functions. User accounts on point -of-sale terminals thathave access to only one card number at a timeto facilitate a single transaction. User accounts that are only authenticated withphishing-resistant authentication factors.MFA is required for both types of access specified in Requirements 8.4.2 and 8.4.3. Therefore, applyingMFA to one type of access does not replace the need to apply another instance of MFA to the other type of access. If an individual first connects to theentity's network via remote access, and then laterinitiates a connection into the CDE from w ithin thenetwork, per this requirement the individual would authenticate using MFA twice, once when connecting via remote access to the entity's network and once when connecting from the entity's networkinto the CDE.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceThe MFA requirements apply for all types of systemcomponents, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications , network security devices,workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes access directly to an entity's networks or systems as well as web -based access to an application orfunction.MFA for access into the CDE can be implementedat the network or system application level; it does not have to be applied at both levels. For example, if MFA is used when a user connects to the CDE network, it does not have to be used when the user logs into each system or application within the CDE.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequiring more than one type of authenticationfactor reduces the probability that an attacker cangain access to a system by masquerading as alegitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. This is especially true in environments wheretraditionally the single authentication factoremployed was something a user knows, such as a password or passphrase.DefinitionsMulti -factor authentication (MFA) requires anindividual to present a minimum of two of the three authentication factors specified inRequirement 8.3.1 before access is granted.Using one factor twice (for example, using twoseparate passwords) is not considered multi -factor authentication.(continued on next page) 8.4.3 MFA is implemented for all remote accessoriginating from outside the entity's network that could access or impact the CDE. 8.4.3.a Examine network and or systemconfigurations for remote access servers and systems to verify MFA is required in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.8.4.3.b Observe personnel (for example, users andadministrators) and third parties connecting remotely to the network and verify that multi -factorauthentication is required.Customized Approach ObjectiveRemote access to the entity's network cannot be obtained by using a single authentication factor.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThe requirement for MFA for remote accessoriginating from outside the entity's network applies to all user accounts that can access the networkremotely, where that remote access leads to or could lead to access into the CDE. This includes all remote access by personnel (users andadministrators), and third parties (including, but notlimited to, vendors, suppliers, service providers, and customers).If remote access is to a part of the entity's network that is properly segmented from the CDE, such that remote users cannot access or impact the CDE, MFA for remote access to that part of the network is not required. However, MFA is required for anyremot e access to networks with access to the CDEand is recommended for all remote access to theentity's networks.The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications , network security devices,workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includesaccess directly to an entity's networks or systems aswell as web -based access to an application orfunction.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.5 Multi -factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePoorly configured MFA systems can be bypassedby attackers. This requirement thereforeaddresses configuration of MFA system(s) thatprovide MFA for users accessing systemcomponents in the CDE.DefinitionsUsing one type of factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi -factor authentication.A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts avalid transmission of data and then resends orredirects this communication for malicious purposes. In MFA implementations, replay attacks are typically used to gain unauthorized access by leveraging legitim ate credentials.ExamplesExamples of methods to help protect against replay attacks include, but are not limited to: Unique session identifiers and session keys Timestamps Time -based, one-time passwords orpasscodes Anti-replay mechanisms that detect and reject duplicated authentication attempts.(continued on next page)8.5.1 MFA systems are implemented as follows: The MFA system is not susceptible to replayattacks. MFA systems cannot be bypassed by any users,including administrative users unless specifically documented, and authorized by management on an exception basis, for a limited time period. At least two different types of authenticationfactors are used. Success of all authentication factors is requiredbefore access is granted. 8.5.1.a Examine vendor system documentation toverify that the MFA system is not susceptible to replay attacks.8.5.1.b Examine system configurations for theMFA implementation to verify it is configured inaccordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.8.5.1.c Interview responsible personnel andobserve processes to verify that any requests tobypass MFA are specifically documented andauthorized by management on an exception basis,for a limited time period.8.5.1.d Observe personnel logging into systemcomponents in the CDE to verify that access isgranted only after all authentication factors aresuccessful.8.5.1.e Observe personnel connecting remotelyfrom outside the entity's network to verify that access is granted only after all authentication factors are successful.Customized Approach ObjectiveMFA systems are resistant to attack and strictly control any administrative overrides.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Further InformationFor more information about MFA systems andfeatures, refer to the following:PCI SSC's Information Supplement: Multi -FactorAuthenticationPCI SSC's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on this topic. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeLike individual user accounts, system andapplication accounts require accountability andstrict management to ensure they are used onlyfor the intended purpose and are not misused.Attackers often compromise system or applicationaccounts to gain access to cardholder data.Good PracticeWhere possible, configure system and application accounts to disallow interactive login to prevent unauthorized individuals from logging in and usingthe account with its associated system privileges,and to limit the machines and devices on which the acco unt can be used.DefinitionsInteractive login is the ability for a person to log into a system or application account in the same manner as a normal user account. Using system and application accounts this way means there isno accountability and traceability of actions takenby the user.Refer to Appendix G for the definition ofapplication and system accounts . 8.6.1 If accounts used by systems or applicationscan be used for interactive login, they are managedas follows: Interactive use is prevented unless needed foran exceptional circumstance. Interactive use is limited to the time needed for the exceptional circumstance. Business justification for interactive use is documented. Interactive use is explicitly approved bymanagement. Individual user identity is confirmed beforeaccess to account is granted. Every action taken is attributable to an individual user. 8.6.1 Examine application and system accountsthat can be used interactively and interviewadministrative personnel to verify that applicationand system accounts are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveWhen used interactively, all actions with accounts designated as system or application accounts are authorized and attributable to an individual person.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeNot properly protecting passwords passphrasesused by application and system accounts, especially if those accounts can be used for interactive login, increases the risk and success of unauthorized use of those privileged accounts.Good PracticeChanging these values due to suspected orconfirmed disclosure can be particularly difficult to implement.Tools can facilitate both management and security of authentication factors for applicationand system accounts. For example, consider password vaults or other system -managedcontrols. 8.6.2 Passwords passphrases for any applicationand system accounts that can be used forinteractive login are not hard coded in scripts, configuration property files, or bespoke and custom source code. 8.6.2.a Interview personnel and examine systemdevelopment procedures to verify that processes are defined for application and system accounts that can be used for interactive login, specifying that passwords passphrases are not hard coded inscripts, configurati on property files, or bespoke andcustom source code.8.6.2.b Examine scripts, configuration propertyfiles, and bespoke and custom source code for application and system accounts that can be usedfor interactive login, to verify passwords passphrases for those accounts are not present. Customized Approach ObjectivePasswords passphrases used by application and system accounts cannot be used by unauthorized personnel.Applicability NotesStored passwords passphrases are required to be encrypted in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 8.3.2.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSystems and application accounts pose moreinherent security risk than user accounts because they often run in an elevated security context, with access to systems that may not be typically granted to user accounts, such as programmatic access to databases , etc. As a result, specialconsideration must be made to protect passwords passphrases used for application and system accounts.Good PracticeEntities should consider the following risk factorswhen determining how to protect application andsystem passwords passphrases against misuse: How securely the passwords passphrases are stored (for example, whether they are stored in a password vault). Staff turnover. The number of people with access to the authentication factor . Whether the account can be used forinteractive login. Whether the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly (see Requirement 8.3.9).All these elements affect the level of risk for application and system accounts and might impact the security of systems accessed by thesystem and application accounts.(continued on next page) 8.6.3 Passwords passphrases for any applicationand system accounts are protected against misuseas follows: Passwords passphrases are changedperiodically (at the frequency defined in theentity's targeted risk analysis, which isperformed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1) and upon suspicion or confirmation of compromise. Passwords passphrases are constructed with sufficient complexity appropriate for how frequently the entity changes the passwords passphrases. 8.6.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat procedures are defined to protectpasswords passphrases for application or systemaccounts against misuse in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.8.6.3.b Examine the entity's targeted risk analysisfor the change frequency and complexity for passwords passphrases for application and system accounts to verify the risk analysis was performedin accordance with all elements specified inRequirement 12.3.1 and addresses: The frequency defined for periodic changes to application and system passwords passphrases. The complexity defined for passwords passphrases and appropriatenessof the complexity relative to the frequency ofchanges.Customized Approach Objective 8.6.3.c Interview responsible personnel andexamine system configuration settings to verify that passwords passphrases for any application andsystem accounts are protected against misuse in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Passwords passphrases used by application and system accounts cannot be used indefinitely andare structured to resist brute-force and guessing attacks.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance8.6.3 (continued) Entities should correlate their selected changefrequency for application and system passwords passwords with their selected complexity for those passwords passphrases -i.e., the complexity should be more rigorous when passwords passphrases are changed infrequently and can be less rigorous when changed morefrequently. For example, a longer changefrequency is more justifiable when passwords passphrases complexity is set to 36 alphanumeric characters with upper - and lower -case letters, numbers, and special characters.Best practices are to consider password changes at least once a year, a password passphraselength of at least 15 characters, and complexityfor the passwords passphrase of alphanumeric characters, with upper - and lower -case letters,and special characters .Further InformationFor information about variability and equivalency of password strength for passwords passphrases of different formats, see the industry standards(for example, the current version of NIST SP 800 -63 Digital Identity Guidelines ).Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder DataSections9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.OverviewAny physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals toaccess and or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:"

For thisreason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define thecontrols, methods, and processes that arefollowed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected personnel, and are supported by operating proceduresdescribing how to perform activities. 9.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 9 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 9.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 9are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 9 are defined andadhered to by affected personnel. All supportingactivities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintainedwithin separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.A method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 9.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 9 are documented, assigned, and understood. 9.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 9 are documented and assigned.9.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 9 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 9 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout physical access controls, unauthorizedpersons could potentially gain access to the CDE and sensitive information, or could alter systemconfigurations, introduce vulnerabilities into thenetwork, or destroy or steal equipment. Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is that physical access to the CDE is controlled via ph ysicalsecurity controls such as badge readers or other mechanisms such as lock and key.Good PracticeWhichever mechanism meets this requirement, it must be sufficient for the organization to verify that only authorized personnel are granted access.ExamplesFacility entry controls include physical security controls at each computer room, data center, and other physical areas with systems in the CDE. Itcan also include badge readers or other devicesthat manage physical access controls, such as lock and key w ith a current list of all individualsholding the keys. 9.2.1 Appropriate facility entry controls are in placeto restrict physical access to systems in the CDE. 9.2.1 Observe entry controls and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that physicalsecurity controls are in place to restrict access tosystems in the CDE.Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components in the CDE cannot be physically accessed by unauthorized personnel .Applicability NotesThis requirement does not apply to locations that are publicly accessible by consumers (cardholders).Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMaintaining details of individuals entering andexiting the sensitive areas can help with investigations of physical breaches by identifying individuals that physically accessed the sensitive areas, as well as when they entered and exited.Good PracticeWhichever mechanism meet s this requirement, itshould effectively monitor all entry and exit points to sensitive areas.Criminals attempting to gain physical access to sensitive areas will often try to disable or bypass the monitoring controls. To protect these controls from tampering, video cameras could bepositioned so they are out of reach and or bemonitored to detect tampering. Similarly, physicalaccess control mechanisms could be monitored or have physical protections installed to prevent them from being damaged or disabled by malicious individuals. 9.2.1.1 Individual physical access to sensitive areaswithin the CDE is monitored with either video cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or both) as follows: Entry and exit points to from sensitive areaswithin the CDE are monitored. Monitoring devices or mechanisms are protectedfrom tampering or disabling. Collected data is reviewed and correlated with other entries. Collected data is stored for at least three months, unless otherwise restricted by law. 9.2.1.1.a Observe locations where individualphysical access to sensitive areas within the CDEoccurs to verify that either video cameras orphysical access control mechanisms (or both) are in place to monitor the entry and exit points.9.2.1.1.b Observe locations where individualphysical access to sensitive areas within the CDEoccurs to verify that either video cameras orphysical access control mechanisms (or both) areprotected from tampering or disabling.9.2.1.1.c Observe the physical access controlmechanisms and or examine video cameras andinterview responsible personnel to verify that: Collected data from video cameras and orphysical access control mechanisms is reviewed and correlated with other entries. Collected data is stored for at least three months. Customized Approach ObjectiveTrusted, verifiable records are maintained of individual physical entry to, and exit from, sensitiveareas.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRestricting access to network jacks (or networkports) will prevent malicious individuals from plugging into readily available network jacks and gaining access to the CDE or systems connected to the CDE.Good PracticeWhether logical or physical controls, or a combination of both, are used, they should prevent an individual or device that is not explicitly authorized from being able to connect to the network.ExamplesMethods to meet this requirement include networkjacks located in public areas and areas accessible to visitors could be disabled and only enabled when network access is explicitly authorized. Alternatively, processes could be implemented to ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in areas with active network jacks. 9.2.2 Physical and or logical controls areimplemented to restrict use of publicly accessible network jacks within the facility. 9.2.2 Interview responsible personnel and observelocations of publicly accessible network jacks to verify that physical and or logical controls are in place to restrict access to publicly accessible network jacks within the facility.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized devices cannot connect to the entity's network from public areas within the facility.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout appropriate physical security over access to wireless components and devices, and computer networking and telecommunications equipment and lines, malicious users could gainaccess to the entity's network resources .Additionally, they could connect their own devicesto the network to gain unauthorized access to theCDE or systems connected to the CDE.Additionally, securing networking andcommunications hardware prevents malicious users from intercepting network traffic or physically connecting their own devices to wirednetwork resources. 9.2.3 Physical access to wireless access points,gateways, networking communications hardware,and telecommunication lines within the facility is restricted. 9.2.3 Interview responsible personnel and observelocations of hardware and lines to verify that physical access to wireless access points, gateways, networking communications hardware,and telecommunication lines within the facility isrestricted.Customized Approach ObjectivePhysical networking equipment cannot be accessed by unauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeLocking console login screens preventsunauthorized persons from gaining access to sensitive information, altering system configurations, introducing vulnerabilities into thenetwork, or destroying records. 9.2.4 Access to consoles in sensitive areas isrestricted via locking when not in use. 9.2.4 Observe a system administrator's attempt tolog into consoles in sensitive areas and verify that they are locked to prevent unauthorized use.Customized Approach ObjectivePhysical consoles within sensitive areas cannot be used by unauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEstablishing procedures for granting, managing,and removing access when it is no longer needed ensures non-authorized individuals are preventedfrom gaining access to areas containingcardholder data. In addition, it is important to limit access to the actual badging system and badging materials to prevent unauthorized personnel frommaking their own badges and or setting up their own access rules.Good PracticeIt is important to visually identify the personnel that are physically present, and whether the individual is a visitor or an employee.DefinitionsRefer to Appendix G for the definition ofpersonnel. ExamplesOne way to identify personnel is to assign thembadges. 9.3.1 Procedures are implemented for authorizingand managing physical access of personnel to the CDE, including: Identifying personnel. Managing changes to an individual's physicalaccess requirements. Revoking or terminating personnel identification. Limiting access to the identification process or system to authorized personnel. 9.3.1.a Examine documented procedures to verifythat procedures to authorize and manage physicalaccess of personnel to the CDE are defined inaccordance with all elements specified in this requirement.9.3.1.b Observe identification methods, such as IDbadges, and processes to verify that personnel in the CDE are clearly identified.9.3.1.c Observe processes to v erify that access tothe identification process, such as a badge system,is limited to authorized personnel. Customized Approach ObjectiveRequirements for access to the physical CDE are defined and enforced to identify and authorize personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeControlling physical access to sensitive areashelps ensure that only authorized personnel with a legitimate business need are granted access.Good PracticeWhere possible, organizations should have policies and procedures to ensure that beforepersonnel leaving the organization, all physicalaccess mechanisms are returned, or disabled as soon as possible upon their departure. This will ensure personnel cannot gain physical access tosensitive areas once their employment has ended. 9.3.1.1 Physical access to sensitive areas within theCDE for personnel is controlled as follows: Access is authorized and based on individual job function. Access is revoked immediately upontermination. All physical access mechanisms, such as keys,access cards, etc., are returned or disabledupon termination. 9.3.1.1.a Observe personnel in sensitive areaswithin the CDE, interview responsible personnel, and examine physical access control lists to verify that: Access to the sensitive area is authorized. Access is required for the individual's job function.9.3.1.1.b Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify that access of all personnel isrevoked immediately upon termination.9.3.1.1.c For terminated personnel, examinephysical access controls lists and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that all physicalaccess mechanisms (such as keys, access cards,etc.) were returned or disabled. Customized Approach ObjectiveSensitive areas cannot be accessed by unauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeVisitor controls are important to reduce the abilityof unauthorized and malicious persons to gain access to facilities and potentially to cardholder data.Visitor controls ensure visitors are identifiable as visitors so personnel can monitor their activities,and that their access is restricted to just theduration of their legitimate visit.DefinitionsRefer to Appendix G for the definition of visitor . 9.3.2 Procedures are implemented for authorizingand managing visitor access to the CDE, including: Visitors are authorized before entering. Visitors are escorted at all times. Visitors are clearly identified and given a badgeor other identification that expires. Visitor badges or other identification visiblydistinguishes visitors from personnel. 9.3.2.a Examine documented procedures andinterview personnel to verify procedures are defined for authorizing and managing visitor access to the CDE in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.9.3.2.b Observe processes when visitors arepresent in the CDE and interview personnel to verify that visitors are: Authorized before entering the CDE. Escorted at all times within the CDE.9.3.2.c Observe the use of visitor badges or otheridentification to verify that the badge or other identification does not permit unescorted access tothe CDE.9.3.2.d Observe visitors in the CDE to verify that: Visitor badges or other identification are being used for all visitors. Visitor badges or identification easilydistinguish visitors from personnel.9.3.2.e Examine visitor badges or otheridentification and observe evidence in the badging system to verify visitor badges or other identification expires.Customized Approach ObjectiveRequirements for visitor access to the CDE are defined and enforced. Visitors cannot exceed any authorized physical access allowed while in theCDE.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEnsuring that visitor badges are returned ordeactivated upon expiry or completion of the visit prevents malicious persons from using a previously authorized pass to gain physical access into the building after the visit has ended. 9.3.3 Visitor badges or identification aresurrendered or deactivated before visitors leave the facility or at the date of expiration. 9.3.3 Observe visitors leaving the facility andinterview personnel to verify visitor badges or other identification are surrendered or deactivated before visitors leave the facility or at the date of expiration. upon departure or expiration.Customized Approach ObjectiveVisitor identification or badges cannot be reused after expiration.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA visitor log documenting minimum information about the visitor is easy and inexpensive to maintain. It will assist in identifying historicalphysical access to a building or room and potential access to cardholder data.Good PracticeWhen logging the date and time of visit, including both in and out times is considered a best practice, since it provides helpful tracking information and provides assurance that a visitor has left at the end of the day. It is also good to verify that a visitor's ID (driver's license, etc.) matches the name they put on the visitor log. 9.3.4 Visitor logs are used to maintain a physicalrecord of visitor activity both within the facility andwithin sensitive areas, including: The visitor's name and the organization represented. The date and time of the visit. The name of the personnel authorizing physical access. Retaining the log for at least three months, unless otherwise restricted by law. 9.3.4.a Examine the visitor log s and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that visitor log s areused to record physical access to both the facilityand sensitive areas.9.3.4.b Examine the visitor log s and verify that thelogs contain: The visitor's name and the organization represented. The personnel authorizing physical access. Date and time of visit.9.3.4.c Examine visitor log storage locations andinterview responsible personnel to verify that thelog is retained for at least three months, unlessotherwise restricted by law. Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of visitor access that enable the identification of individuals are maintained.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeControls for physically securing media areintended to prevent unauthorized persons fromgaining access to cardholder data on any media.Cardholder data is susceptible to unauthorizedviewing, copying, or scanning if it is unprotected while it is on removable or portable media, printed out, or left on someone's desk. 9.4.1 All media with cardholder data is physicallysecured. 9.4.1. Examine documentation to verify that theprocedures defined for protecting cardholder datainclude controls for physically securing all media.Customized Approach ObjectiveMedia with cardholder data cannot be accessed byunauthorized personnel.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf stored in a non- secured facility, backupscontaining cardholder data may easily be lost,stolen, or copied for malicious intent.Good PracticeFor secure storage of backup media, a good practice is to store media in an off -site facility,such as an alternate or backup site or commercial storage facility. 9.4.1.1 Offline media backups with cardholder dataare stored in a secure location. 9.4.1.1.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined for physically securingoffline media backups with cardholder data in asecure location.9.4.1.1.b Examine logs or other documentationand interview responsible personnel at the storagelocation to verify that offline media backups arestored in a secure location. Customized Approach ObjectiveOffline backups cannot be accessed by unauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeConducting regular reviews of the storage facilityenables the organization to address identified security issues promptly, minimizing the potential risk. It is important for the entity to be aware of the security of the area where media is being stored. 9.4.1.2 The security of the offline media backuplocation(s) with cardholder data is reviewed at least once every 12 months. 9.4.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined for reviewing the security of the offline media backup location(s) with cardholder data at least once every 12 months.9.4.1.2.b Examine documented procedures, logs,or other documentation, and interview responsible personnel at the storage location(s) to verify that the storage location's security is reviewed at least once every 12 months.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security controls protecting offline backups areverified periodically by inspection.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMedia not identified as confidential may not be adequately protected or may be lost or stolen.Good PracticeIt is important that media be identified such that its classification status is apparent. This does not mean however that the media needs to have a confidential label. 9.4.2 All media with cardholder data is classified inaccordance with the sensitivity of the data. 9.4.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined for classifying media with cardholder data in accordance with the sensitivity of the data.9.4.2.b Examine media logs or otherdocumentation to verify that all media is classified in accordance with the sensitivity of the data.Customized Approach ObjectiveMedia are classified and protected appropriately.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMedia may be lost or stolen if sent via a non-trackable method such as regular postal mail. The use of secure couriers to deliver any media that contains cardholder data allows organizations to use their tracking systems to maintain inventory and location of shipments. 9.4.3 Media with cardholder data sent outside thefacility is secured as follows: Media sent outside the facility is logged. Media is sent by secured courier or other delivery method that can be accurately tracked. Offsite tracking logs include details about media location. 9.4.3.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined for securing media sent outside the facility in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.9.4.3.b Interview personnel and examine recordsto verify that all media sent outside the facility is logged and sent via secured courier or other delivery method that can be tracked.9.4.3.c Examine offsite tracking logs for all mediato verify tracking details are documented.Customized Approach ObjectiveMedia is secured and tracked when transported outside the facility.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout a firm process for ensuring that all mediamovements are approved before the media is removed from secure areas, the media would not be tracked or appropriately protected, and its location would be unknown, leading to lost or stolen media. 9.4.4 Management approves all media withcardholder data that is moved outside the facility (including when media is distributed to individuals). 9.4.4.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined to ensure that media moved outside the facility is approved by management.9.4.4.b Examine offsite media tracking logs andinterview responsible personnel to verify that proper management authorization is obtained forall media moved outside the facility (including media distributed to individuals). Customized Approach ObjectiveMedia cannot leave a facility without the approval of accountable personnel.Applicability NotesIndividuals approving media movements should have the appropriate level of management authority to grant this approval. However, it is not specifically required that such individuals have manager as part of their title.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout careful inventory methods and storage controls, stolen or missing electronic media could go unnoticed for an indefinite amount of time. 9.4.5 Inventory logs of all electronic media withcardholder data are maintained. 9.4.5.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined to maintain electronic media inventory logs.9.4.5.b Examine electronic media inventory logsand interview responsible personnel to verify that logs are maintained.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccurate inventories of stored electronic media are maintained.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout careful inventory methods and storagecontrols, stolen or missing electronic media could go unnoticed for an indefinite amount of time. 9.4.5.1 Inventories of electronic media withcardholder data are conducted at least once every 12 months. 9.4.5.1.a Examine documentation to verify thatprocedures are defined to conduct inventories of electronic media with cardholder data at least once every 12 months.9.4.5.1.b Examine electronic media inventory logsand interview personnel to verify that electronic media inventories are performed at least once every 12 months.Customized Approach ObjectiveMedia inventories are verified periodically.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf steps are not taken to destroy informationcontained on hard- copy media before disposal,malicious individuals may retrieve information from the disposed media, leading to a data compromise. For example, malicious individuals may use a technique known a s dumpster diving,where they search through trashcans and recycle bins looking for hard-copy materials with information they can use to launch an attack.Securing storage containers used for materials that are going to be destroyed prevents sensitive information from being captured while the materials are being collected.Good PracticeConsider to- be-shredded containers with a lockthat prevents access to its contents or that physically prevent access to the inside of the container.Further InformationSee NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1:Guidelines for Media Sanitization. 9.4.6 Hard -copy materials with cardholder data aredestroyed when no longer needed for business or legal reasons, as follows: Materials are cross -cut shredded, incinerated, orpulped so that cardholder data cannot bereconstructed. Materials are stored in secure storagecontainers prior to destruction. 9.4.6.a Examine the media destruction policy toverify that procedures are defined to destroy hard-copy media with cardholder data when no longer needed for business or legal reasons in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.9.4.6.b Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify that hard- copy materials arecross -cut shredded, incinerated, or pulped suchthat cardholder data cannot be reconstructed.9.4.6.c Observe storage containers used formaterials that contain information to be destroyedto verify that the containers are secure. Customized Approach ObjectiveCardholder data cannot be recovered from media that has been destroyed or which is pending destruction.Applicability NotesThese requirements for media destruction when that media is no longer needed for business or legalreasons are separate and distinct from PCI DSSRequirement 3.2.1, which is for securely deleting cardholder data when no longer needed per the entity's cardholder data retention policies.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf steps are not taken to destroy informationcontained on electronic media when no longer needed, malicious individuals may retrieve information from the disposed media, leading to a data compromise. For example, malicious individuals may use a technique known asdumpster diving, where they search throughtrashcans and recycle bins looking for information they can use to launch an attack.Good PracticeThe deletion function in most operating systemsallows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion function or applicationshould be used to make data unrecoverable.ExamplesMethods for securely destroying electronic mediainclude secure wiping in accordance with industry -accepted standards for secure deletion,degaussing, or physical destruction (such as grinding or shredding hard disks).Further InformationSee NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1:Guidelines for Media Sanitization 9.4.7 Electronic media with cardholder data isdestroyed when no longer needed for business orlegal reasons via one of the following: The electronic media is destroyed. The cardholder data is rendered unrecoverableso that it cannot be reconstructed. 9.4.7.a Examine the media destruction policy toverify that procedures are defined to destroyelectronic media when no longer needed for business or legal reasons in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.9.4.7.b Observe the media destruction processand interview responsible personnel to verify that electronic media with cardholder data is destroyed via one of the methods specified in thisrequirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveCardholder data cannot be recovered from mediathat has been erased or destroyed.Applicability NotesThese requirements for media destruction when that media is no longer needed for business or legal reasons are separate and distinct from PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1, which is for securely deleting cardholder data when no longer needed per the entity's cardholder data retention policies.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.5 Point -of-interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCriminals attempt to steal payment card data bystealing and or manipulating card-reading devices and terminals. Criminals will try to steal devicesso they can learn how to break into them, andthey often try to replace legitimate devices with fraudulent devices that send them payment carddata every time a card is entered.They will also try to add skimming components to the outside of devices, which are designed to capture payment card data before it enters thedevice-for example, by attaching an additionalcard reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment card data is captured twice: once by the criminal's component and then by the device's legitimate component. In this way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is skimming the payment card data during the process . 9.5.1 POI devices that capture payment card datavia direct physical interaction with the payment cardform factor are protected from tampering andunauthorized substitution, including the following: Maintaining a list of POI devices. Periodically inspecting POI devices to look for tampering or unauthorized substitution. Training personnel to be aware of suspicious behavior and to report tampering or unauthorized substitution of devices. 9.5.1 Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify that processes are definedthat include all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity has defined procedures to protect and manage point -of-interaction devices. Expectations,controls, and oversight for the management andprotection of POI devices are defined and adhered to by affected personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes (continued on next page)Good PracticeEntities may consider implementing protectionfrom tampering and unauthorized substitution for: Components used only for manual PAN keyentry. Commercial off -the-shelf (COTS) devices (forexample, smartphones or tablets), which aremobile merchant -owned devices designed formass -market distribution.Further InformationAdditional best practices on skimming prevention are available on the PCI SSC website. These requirements apply to deployed POI devices used in card- present transactions (that is, apayment card form factor such as a card that is swiped, tapped, or dipped).These requirement s do not apply to: Components used only for manual PAN keyentry . Commercial off -the-shelf (COTS) devices (forexample, smartphones or tablets), which are mobile merchant -owned devices designed formass -market distribution.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeKeeping an up-to -date list of POI devices helpsan organization track where devices are supposed to be and quickly identify if a device is missing or lost.(continued on next page)9.5.1.1 An up -to-date list of POI devices ismaintained, including: Make and model of the device. Location of device. Device serial number or other methods ofunique identification. 9.5.1.1.a Examine the list of POI devices to verify itincludes all elements specified in this requirement.9.5.1.1.b Observe POI devices and devicelocations and compare to devices in the list toverify that the list is accurate and up to date.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective 9.5.1.1.c Interview personnel to verify the list ofPOI devices is updated when devices are added,relocated, decommissioned, etc. Good PracticeThe method for maintaining a list of devices may be automated (for example, a device-management system) or manual (for example, documented in electronic or paper records). For on-the -road devices, the location may include thename of the personnel to whom the device isassigned.ExamplesMethods to maintain device locations includeidentifying the address of the site or facility where the device is located. The identity and location of POI devices is recorded and known at all times.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegular inspections of devices will helporganizations detect tampering more quickly via external evidence-for example, the addition of a card skimmer -or replacement of a device,thereby minimizing the potential impact of using fraudulent devices.Good PracticeMethods for periodic inspection include checking the serial number or other device characteristics and comparing the information to the list of POI devices to verify the device has not been swapped with a fraudulent device.(continued on next page) 9.5.1.2 POI device surfaces are periodicallyinspected to detect tampering and unauthorizedsubstitution.9.5.1.2.a Examine documented procedures toverify processes are defined for periodic inspections of POI device surfaces to detect tampering and unauthorized substitution.9.5.1.2.b Interview responsible personnel andobserve inspection processes to verify: Personnel are aware of procedures for inspecting devices. All devices are periodically inspected forevidence of tampering and unauthorizedsubstitution. Customized Approach ObjectivePoint of interaction devices cannot be tamperedwith, substituted without authorization, or have skimming attachments installed without timely detection.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.5.1.2 (continued) ExamplesThe type of inspection will depend on the device.For instance, photographs of devices known to be secure can be used to compare a device's current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV lightmarker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect su ch activities.Device vendors may also provide security guidance and how to guides to help determinewhether the device has been subject totampering.Signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include: Unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device. Missing or changed security labels. Broken or differently colored casing. Changes to the serial number or other external markings.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEntities are best placed to determine thefrequency of POI device inspections based on the environment in which the device operates.Good PracticeThe frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as the location of a device andwhether the device is attended or unattended. Forexample, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization's personnel might have more frequent in spections than devices keptin secure areas or supervised when accessible to the public. In addition, many POI vendors include guidance in their user documentation about howoften POI devices should be checked, and forwhat - entities should consult their vendors'documentation and incorporate those recommendations into their periodic inspections. 9.5.1.2.1 The frequency of periodic POI deviceinspections and the type of inspections performed is defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. 9.5.1.2.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of periodic POI device inspections and type of inspections performed to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1.9.5.1.2.1.b Examine documented results ofperiodic device inspections and interview personnel to verify that the frequency and type of POI device inspections performed match what isdefined in the entity's targeted risk analysisconducted for this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectivePOI devices are inspected at a frequency that addresses the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCriminals will often pose as authorizedmaintenance personnel to gain access to POI devices.Good PracticePersonnel training should include being alert to and questioning anyone who shows up to do POImaintenance to ensure they are authorized andhave a valid work order, including any agents, maintenance or repair personnel, technicians, service providers, or other third parties. All thirdparties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being provided access -for example, by checking withmanagement or phoning the POI maintenance company, such as the vendor or acquirer , forverification. Ma ny criminals will try to foolpersonnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so personnel should be trained to always follow procedures.Another trick that criminals use is to send a new POI device with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate device and returning the legitimate device. The criminals may even provide return postage to their specified address. Therefore, personnel should always verify with their manageror supplier that the device is legitimate and camefrom a trusted source before installing it or using itfor business.(continued on next page) 9.5.1.3 Training is provided for personnel in POIenvironments to be aware of attempted tampering or replacement of POI devices, and includes: Verifying the identity of any third-party persons claiming to be repair or maintenance personnel,before granting them access to modify ortroubleshoot devices. Procedures to ensure devices are not installed, replaced, or returned without verification. Being aware of suspicious behavior around devices. Reporting suspicious behavior and indications of device tampering or substitution to appropriatepersonnel. 9.5.1.3.a Review training materials for personnel inPOI environments to verify they include allelements specified in this requirement.9.5.1.3.b Interview personnel in POI environmentsto verify they have received training and know the procedures for all elements specified in this requirement .Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel are knowledgeable about the types ofattacks against POI devices, the entity's technicaland procedural countermeasures, and can access assistance and guidance when required.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance9.5.1.3 (continued) ExamplesSuspicious behavior that personnel should beaware of includes attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices.Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for reporting suspicious behavior and who to report such behavior to-for example, a manager orsecurity officer -will help reduce the likelihoodand potential impact of a device being tamperedwith or substituted.Regularly Monitor and Test NetworksRequirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder DataSections10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined andunderstood.10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.10.6 Time -synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.OverviewLogging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise.The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysiswhen something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and otherthird parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined andunderstood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 10.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies andprocedures specified throughout Requirement 10. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 10, it is equally import ant to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes,technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's securityobjectives and principles. Operational proceduresdescribe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 10.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 10are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties. 10.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement10 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 10 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supportingactivities are repeatable, consistently applied, andconform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance andunderstanding of their assigned roles andresponsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 10.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 10 are documented, assigned, and understood. 10.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 10 are documented and assigned.10.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 10 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as defined and are understood.Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 10 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.2 Audit l ogs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAudit logs must exist for all system components.Audit logs send alerts the system administrator,provides data to other monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and security information and event monitoring systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail for post -incident investigation.Logging and analyzing security -relevant eventsenable an organization to identify and trace potentially malicious activities.Good PracticeWhen an entity considers which information to record in their logs, it is important to remember that information stored in audit logs is sensitive and should be protected per requirements in thisstandard. Care should be taken to only storeessential information in the audit logs to minimize risk. 10.2.1 Audit logs are enabled and active for allsystem components and cardholder data. 10.2.1 Interview the system administrator andexamine system configurations to verify that audit logs are enabled and active for all system components.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all activities affecting system components and cardholder data are captured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is critical to have a process or system that links user access to system components accessed. Malicious individuals could obtain knowledge of a user account with access to systems in the CDE,or they could create a new, unauthorized account to access cardholder data.Good PracticeA record of all individual access to cardholderdata can identify which accounts may have beencompromised or misused. 10.2.1.1 Audit logs capture all individual useraccess to cardholder data. 10.2.1.1 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that all individual user access to cardholder data is logged.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all individual user access to cardholder data are captured.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAccounts with increased access privileges, suchas the administrator or root account, have the potential to significantly impact the security oroperational functionality of a system. Without alog of the activities performed, an organization is cannot trace any issues resulting from an administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back to the specific action and account.DefinitionsThe functions or activities considered to be administrative are beyond those performed byregular users as part of routine businessfunctions.Refer to Appendix G for the definition ofadministrative access. 10.2.1.2 Audit logs capture all actions taken by anyindividual with administrative access, including any interactive use of application or system accounts . 10.2.1.2 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that all actions taken by any individual with administrative access, including any interactive use of application or system accounts,are logged.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all actions performed by individuals withelevated privileges are captured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMalicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to hide their actions. A record of access allows an organization to trace any inconsistencies or potential tampering of the logs to an individual account . Having logs identify changes, additions,and deletions to the audit logs can help retracesteps made by unauthorized personnel.10.2.1.3 Audit logs capture all access to audit logs. 10.2.1.3 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that access to all audit logs iscaptured.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all access to audit logs are captured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMalicious individuals will often perform multiple access attempts on targeted systems. Multiple 10.2.1.4 Audit logs capture all invalid logical accessattempts.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective 10.2.1.4 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that invalid logical access attemptsare captured. invalid login attempts may be an indication of anunauthorized user's attempts to brute force or guess a password.Records of all invalid access attempts are captured.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeLogging changes to authentication credentials(including elevation of privileges, additions, and deletions of accounts with administrative access)provides residual evidence of activities.Malicious users may attempt to manipulateauthentication credentials to bypass them or impersonate a valid account. 10.2.1.5 Audit logs capture all changes toidentification and authentication credentialsincluding, but not limited to: Creation of new accounts . Elevation of privileges. All changes, additions, or deletions to accounts with administrative access . 10.2.1.5 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that changes to identification and authentication credentials are captured in accordance with all elements specified in thisrequirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all changes to identification andauthentication credentials are captured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTurning off or pausing audit logs beforeperforming illicit activities is common practice formalicious users who want to avoid detection. Initialization of audit logs could indicate that that a user disabled the log function to hide their actions. 10.2.1.6 Audit logs capture the following: All initialization of new audit logs, and All starting, stopping, or pausing of the existing audit logs. 10.2.1.6 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that all elements specified in thisrequirement are captured.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of all changes to audit log activity status are captured.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMalicious software, such as malware, oftencreates or replaces system -level objects on thetarget system to control a particular function oroperation on that system. By logging whensystem- level objects are created or deleted, it willbe easier to determine whether such modifications were authorized. 10.2.1.7 Audit logs capture all creation and deletionof system -level objects. 10.2.1.7 Examine audit log configurations and logdata to verify that creation and deletion of system level objects is captured.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords of alterations that indicate a system has been modified from its intended functionality are captured.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeBy recording these details for the auditable events at 10.2.1.1 through 10.2.1.7, a potentialcompromise can be quickly identified, with sufficient detail to facilitate following up onsuspicious activities. 10.2.2 Audit logs record the following details foreach auditable event: User identification. Type of event. Date and time. Success and failure indication. Origination of event. Identity or name of affected data, systemcomponent, resource, or service (for example, name and protocol). 10.2.2 Interview personnel and examine audit logconfigurations and log data to verify that allelements specified in this requirement are included in log entries for each auditable event (from 10.2.1.1 through 10.2.1.7).Customized Approach ObjectiveSufficient data to be able to identify successful and failed attempts and who, what, when, where, and how for each event listed in requirement 10.2.1 are captured.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAudit log files contain sensitive information, andread access to the log files must be limited only to those with a valid business need. This access includes audit log files on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored.Good PracticeAdequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control that limits access to logsbased on need to know only and the use ofphysical or network segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify. 10.3.1 Read access to audit logs files is limited tothose with a job-related need. 10.3.1 Interview system administrators andexamine system configurations and privileges to verify that only individuals with a job -related needhave read access to audit log files.Customized Approach ObjectiveStored activity records cannot be accessed byunauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeOften a malicious individual who has entered thenetwork will try to edit the audit logs to hide their activity. Without adequate protection of audit logs,their completeness, accuracy, and integritycannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be rendered useless as an investigation tool after a compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be protected on the originating systems as well asanywhere else they are stored.Good PracticeEntities should attempt to prevent logs from beingexposed in public -accessible locations. 10.3.2 Audit log files are protected to preventmodifications by individuals. 10.3.2 Examine system configurations andprivileges and interview system administrators toverify that current audit log files are protected from modifications by individuals via access controlmechanisms, physical segregation, and or networksegregation. Customized Approach ObjectiveStored activity records cannot be modified by personnel.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePromptly backing up the logs to a centralized logserver or media that is difficult to alter keeps thelogs protected, even if the system generating the logs becomes compromised.Writing logs from external -facing technologiessuch as wireless, network security controls, DNS,and mail servers, reduces the risk of those logs being lost or altered.Good PracticeEach entity determines the best way to back up log files, whether via one or more centralized log servers or other secure media. Logs may be written directly, offloaded, or copied from external systems to the secure internal system or media. 10.3.3 Audit log files, including those for external -facing technologies, are promptly backed up to asecure, central, internal log server(s) or other mediathat is difficult to modify. 10.3.3 Examine backup configurations or log filesto verify that current audit log files, including thosefor external-facing technologies, are promptlybacked up to a secure, central, internal log server(s) or other media that is difficult to modify.Customized Approach ObjectiveStored activity records are secured and preserved in a central location to prevent unauthorizedmodification.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFile integrity monitoring or change-detectionsystems check for changes to critical files and notify when such changes are identified. For fileintegrity monitoring purposes, an entity usuallymonitors files that do not regularly change, but when changed, indicate a possible compromise.Good PracticeSoftware used to monitor changes to audit logs should be configured to provide alerts when existing log data or files are changed or deleted. However, new log data being added to an auditlog should not generate an alert. 10.3.4 File integrity monitoring or change-detectionmechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure thatexisting log data cannot be changed withoutgenerating alerts. 10.3.4 Examine system settings, monitored files,and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of file integrity monitoring or change- detectionsoftware on audit logs.Customized Approach ObjectiveStored activity records cannot be modified withoutan alert being generated.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMany breaches occur months before being detected.Regular log reviews mean incidents can be quicklyidentified and proactively addressed.Good PracticeChecking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a year, including holidays) minimizes the amount oftime and exposure of a potential breach. Logharvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralizedlog management systems, event log analyzers, andsecurity information and event management (SIEM) solutions are examples of automated tools that canbe used to meet this requirement.Daily review of security events -for example,notifications or alerts that identify suspicious oranomalous activities- as well as logs from criticalsystem components, and logs from systems thatperform security functions, such as firewalls,IDS IPS, file i ntegrity monitoring (FIM) systems, etc.,is necessary to identify potential issues.The determination of security event will vary foreach organization and may include consideration forthe type of technology, location, and function of the device. Organizations may also wish to maintain abaseline of normal traffic to help identify an omalousbehavior.An entity that uses third -party service providers toperform log review services is responsible to providecontext about the entity's environment to the serviceproviders, so it understands the entity's environment,has a baseline of normal traffic for t he entity, andcan detect potential security issues and provide accurate exceptions and anomaly notifications. 10.4.1 The following audit logs are reviewed at leastonce daily: All security events. Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD and or SAD. Logs of all critical system components. Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (for example, networksecurity controls, intrusion- detectionsystems intrusion -prevention systems (IDS IPS),authentication servers). 10.4.1.a Examine security policies and procedures toverify that processes are defined for reviewing all elements specified in this requirement at least oncedaily.10.4.1.b Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify that all elements specified inthis requirement are reviewed at least once dailyCustomized Approach ObjectivePotentially suspicious or anomalous activities arequickly identified to minimize impact.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeManual log reviews are difficult to perform, evenfor one or two systems, due to the amount of log data that is generated. However, using logharvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralizedlog management systems, event log analyzers, and security inf ormation and event management(SIEM) solutions can help facilitate the process by identifying log events that need to be reviewed.Good PracticeEstablishing a baseline of normal audit activitypatterns is critical to the effectiveness of anautomated log review mechanism. The analysis ofnew audit activity against the established baseline can significantly improve the identification of suspicious or anomalous activities.The entity should keep logging tools aligned with any changes in their environment by periodically reviewing tool settings and updating settings toreflect any changes.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: EffectiveDaily Log Monitoring for additional guidance. 10.4.1.1 Automated mechanisms are used toperform audit log reviews. 10.4.1.1 Examine log review mechanisms andinterview personnel to verify that automated mechanisms are used to perform log reviews.Customized Approach ObjectivePotentially suspicious or anomalous activities areidentified via a repeatable and consistent mechanism.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePeriodic review of logs for all other systemcomponents (not specified in Requirement 10.4.1) helps to identify indications of potential issues orattempts to access critical systems via less- criticalsystems. 10.4.2 Logs of all other system components (thosenot specified in Requirement 10.4.1) are reviewedperiodically . 10.4.2.a Examine security policies and proceduresto verify that processes are defined for reviewing logs of all other system components periodically.10.4.2.b Examine documented results of logreviews and interview personnel to verify that log reviews are performed periodically.Customized Approach ObjectivePotentially suspicious or anomalous activities forother system components (not included in 10.4.1)are reviewed in accordance with the entity's identified risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement is applicable to all other in-scope system components not included in Requirement 10.4.1.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEntities can determine the optimum period toreview these logs based on criteria such as the complexity of each entity's environment, thenumber of types of systems that are required tobe evaluated, and the functions of such systems. 10.4.2.1 The frequency of periodic log reviews forall other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) is defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performedaccording to all elements specified in Requirement12.3.1 10.4.2.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of periodic log reviews for all other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) to verify the risk analysis wasperformed in accordance with all elementsspecified at Requirement 12.3.1.10.4.2.1.b Examine documented results of periodiclog reviews of all other system components (notdefined in Requirement 10.4.1) and interviewpersonnel to verify log reviews are performed at the frequency specified in the entity's targeted risk analysis performed f or this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveLog reviews for lower -risk system components areperformed at a frequency that addresses the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf exceptions and anomalies identified during thelog-review process are not investigated, the entity may be unaware of unauthorized and potentiallymalicious activities occurring within their network.Good PracticeEntities should consider how to address thefollowing when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies: How log review activities are recorded, How to rank and prioritize exceptions andanomalies, What procedures should be in place to reportand escalate exceptions and anomalies, and Who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks. 10.4.3 Exceptions and anomalies identified duringthe review process are addressed. 10.4.3.a Examine security policies and proceduresto verify that processes are defined for addressing exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process.10.4.3.b Observe processes and interviewpersonnel to verify that, when exceptions and anomalies are identified, they are addressed.Customized Approach ObjectiveSuspicious or anomalous activities are addressed.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRetaining historical audit logs for at least 12months is necessary because compromises often go unnoticed for significant lengths of time. Having centrally stored log history allows investigators to better determine the length of time a potential breach w as occurring, and thepossible system(s) impacted. By having three months of logs immediately available, an entitycan quickly identify and minimize impact of a databreach.ExamplesMethods that allow logs to be immediately available include storing logs online, archiving logs, or restoring logs quickly from backups. 10.5.1 Retain audit log history for at least 12months, with at least the most recent three months immediately available for analysis. 10.5.1.a Examine documentation to verify that thefollowing is defined: Audit log retention policies. Procedures for retaining audit log history for at least 12 months, with at least the most recent three months immediately available online.10.5.1.b Examine configurations of audit loghistory, interview personnel and examine audit logs to verify that audit logs history is retained for at least 12 months.10.5.1.c Interview personnel and observeprocesses to verify that at least the most recent three months' audit log history is immediately available for analysis.Customized Approach ObjectiveHistorical records of activity are available immediately to support incident response and areretained for at least 12 months.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.6 Time -synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTime synchronization technology is used tosynchronize clocks on multiple systems. When clocks are not properly synchronized, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to compare log files from different systems and establish an exact sequence of events, whi ch is crucial for forensicanalysis following a breach.For post -incident forensics teams, the accuracyand consistency of time across all systems and the time of each activity are critical in determining how the systems were compromised.ExamplesNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is one example oftime-synchronization technology. 10.6.1 System clocks and time are synchronizedusing time -synchronization technology. 10.6.1 Examine system configuration settings toverify that time -synchronization technology isimplemented and kept current.Customized Approach ObjectiveCommon time is established across all systems.Applicability NotesKeeping time- synchronization technology currentincludes managing vulnerabilities and patching thetechnology according to PCI DSS Requirements6.3.1 and 6.3.3.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeUsing reputable time servers is a criticalcomponent of the time synchronization process.Accepting time updates from specific, industry -accepted external sources helps prevent a malicious individual from changing time settings on systems.Good PracticeAnother option to prevent unauthorized use of internal time servers is to encrypt updates with a symmetric key and create access control lists that specify the IP addresses of client machines thatwill be provided with the time updates. 10.6.2 Systems are configured to the correct andconsistent time as follows: One or more designated time servers are in use. Only the designated central time server(s) receives time from external sources. Time received from external sources is based onInternational Atomic Time or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The designated time server(s) accept time updates only from specific industry -acceptedexternal sources. Where there is more than one designated time server, the time servers peer with one another to keep accurate time. Internal systems receive time information only from designated central time server(s). 10.6.2 Examine system configuration settings foracquiring, distributing, and storing the correct time to verify the settings are configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe time on all systems is accurate and consistent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAttackers will try to change time configurations tohide their activity. Therefore, restricting the ability to change or modify time synchronizationconfigurations or the system time toadministrators will lessen the probability of an attacker successfully changing time configurations. 10.6.3 Time synchronization settings and data areprotected as follows: Access to time data is restricted to only personnel with a business need. Any changes to time settings on critical systems are logged, monitored, and reviewed. 10.6.3.a Examine system configurations and time-synchronization settings to verify that access to time data is restricted to only personnel with a business need.10.6.3.b Examine system configurations and timesynchronization settings and logs and observe processes to verify that any changes to time settings on critical systems are logged, monitored,and reviewed.Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem time settings cannot be modified byunauthorized personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout formal processes to detect and alertwhen critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise system components and steal account data from theCDE.Good PracticeThe specific types of failures may vary, dependingon the function of the device system component and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner, such as a firewall er asing all its rules or going offline. 10.7.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Failures of critical security controlsystems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems: Network security controls .

It includes twoadditional critical security control systems not in Requirement 10.7.1.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf alerts from failures of critical security controlsystems are not responded to quickly and effectively, attackers may use this time to insertmalicious software, gain control of a system, orsteal data from the entity's environment.Good PracticeDocumented evidence (for example, records within a problem management system) should provide support that processes and procedures are in place to respond to security failures. In addition, personnel should be aware of theirresponsibilities in the event of a failure. Actionsand responses to the failure should be captured in the documented evidence. 10.7.3 Failures of any critical security controlsystems are responded to promptly, including but not limited to: Restoring security functions. Identifying and documenting the duration (date and time from start to end) of the security failure. Identifying and documenting the cause(s) of failure and documenting required remediation. Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure. Determining whether further actions are requiredas a result of the security failure. Implementing controls to prevent the cause offailure from reoccurring. Resuming monitoring of security controls. 10.7.3.a Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that processes are defined and implemented to respond to a failure of any critical security control system and include at least allelements specified in this requirement.10.7.3.b Examine records to verify that failures ofcritical security control systems are documented toinclude: Identification of cause(s) of the failure. Duration (date and time start and end) of the security failure.

Resulting security issues are addressed, and measures taken to prevent reoccurrence.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity beingassessed is a service provider until 31 March 2025,after which this requirement will apply to all entities.This is a current v3.2.1 requirement that applies toservice providers only. However, this requirement isa best practice for all other entities until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment .Requirement 11: Test Security of Systems and Networks RegularlySections11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.OverviewVulnerabilities are being discovered continually by malicious individuals and researchers, as well as being introduced by new software. Systemcomponents, processes, and bespoke and custom software should be tested frequently to ensure security controls continue to reflect achanging environment.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRequirement 11.1.1 is about effectively managingand maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 11. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 11, it is equally import ant to ensure they are properlydocumented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and proceduresas needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity's security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. 11.1.1 All security policies and operationalprocedures that are identified in Requirement 11 are: Documented. Kept up to date. In use. Known to all affected parties . 11.1.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExpectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 11 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management's intent.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf roles and responsibilities are not formallyassigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activitiesmay not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documentedwithin policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles andresponsibilities, entities can consider havingpersonnel acknowledge their acceptance andunderstanding of their assigned roles andresponsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilitiesis a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix). 11.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performingactivities in Requirement 11 are documented, assigned, and understood. 11.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify thatdescriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 11 aredocumented and assigned.11.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility forperforming activities in Requirement 11 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned asdocumented and are understood. Customized Approach ObjectiveDay-to-day responsibilities for performing all theactivities in Requirement 11 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeImplementation and or exploitation of wirelesstechnology within a network are common paths for malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the network and cardholder data. Unauthorized wireless devices could be hidden within or attached to a computer or other system component. These devices could also be attached directly to a network port, to a networkdevice such as a switch or router, or inserted as awireless interface card inside a system component.Even if a company has a policy prohibiting the use of wireless technologies, an unauthorized wireless device or network could be installed without the company's knowledge, allowing anattacker to enter the network easily and invisibly.Detecting and removing such unauthorized access points reduces the duration and likelihood of such devices being leveraged for an attack.(continued on next page) 11.2.1 Authorized and unauthorized wireless accesspoints are managed as follows: The presence of wireless (Wi -Fi) access pointsis tested for, All authorized and unauthorized wireless accesspoints are detected and identified, Testing, detection, and identification occurs atleast once every three months. If automated monitoring is used, personnel arenotified via generated alerts. 11.2.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verifyprocesses are defined for managing both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points with all elements specified in this requirement.11.2.1.b Examine the methodology(ies) in use andthe resulting documentation, and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points in accordance with all elements specified in this re quirement.11.2.1.c Examine wireless assessment results andinterview personnel to verify that wireless assessments were conducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.2.1.d If automated monitoring is used, examineconfiguration settings to verify the configuration will generate alerts to notify personnel.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized wireless access points are identified and addressed periodically.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeThe size and complexity of an environment willdictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a roguewireless access point has not been installed in theenvironment.For example, performing a detailed physical inspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in a shopping mall, where all communication components are contained within tamper -resistantand tamper -evident casings, may be sufficient toprovide assurance that a rogue wireless accesspoint has not been attached or installed. However, in an environment with multiple nodes (such as in a large retail store, call center, server room or data center), detailed physical inspection can be difficult. In this case, multiple methods may be combined, such as performing physical system inspections in conjunction with the resultsof a wireless analyzer.DefinitionsThis is also referred to as rogue access pointdetection.ExamplesMethods that may be used include but are not limited to wireless network scans, physical logical inspections of system components andinfrastructure, network access control (NAC), orwireless IDS IPS. NAC and wireless IDS IPS are examples of automated monitoring tools. The requirement applies even when a policy exists that prohibits the use of wireless technology.Methods used to meet this requirement must be sufficient to detect and identify both authorized andunauthorized devices, including unauthorizeddevices attached to devices that themselves are authorized.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn inventory of authorized wireless access pointscan help administrators quickly respond when unauthorized wireless access points are detected.This helps to proactively minimize the exposure ofCDE to malicious individuals.Good PracticeIf using a wireless scanner, it is equally important to have a defined list of known access points which, while not attached to the company's network, will usually be detected during a scan. These non-company devices are often found inmulti -tenant buildings or businesses located nearone another. However, it is important to verify thatthese devices are not connected to the entity's network port or through another network -connected device and given an SSID resembling a nearby business. Scan results should note such devices and how it was determined that thesedevices could be ignored. In addition, detectionof any unauthorized wireless access points that are determined to be a threat to the CDE should be managed following the entity's incident response plan per Requirement 12.10.1. 11.2.2 An inventory of authorized wireless accesspoints is maintained, including a documented business justification. 11.2.2 Examine documentation to verify that aninventory of authorized wireless access points is maintained, and a business justification isdocumented for all authorized wireless accesspoints.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized wireless access points are not mistaken for authorized wireless access points.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIdentifying and addressing vulnerabilities promptlyreduces the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential compromise of a system component or cardholder data. Vulnerability scans conducted at least every three months provide this detection and identification.Good PracticeVulnerabilities posing the greatest risk to theenvironment (for example, ranked high or criticalper Requirement 6.3.1) should be resolved with the highest priority. Vulnerabilities identified during internal vulnerability scans should be part of a vulnerability management process that includes multiple vulnerability sources, as specified in Requirement 6.3.1.Multiple scan reports can be combined for the quarterly scan process to show that all systems were scanned and all applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of the three-month vulnerability scan cycle. However, additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being resolved.While scans are required at least once every three months, more frequent scans are recommended depending on the network complexity, frequency of change, and types of devices, software, and operating systems used.(continued on next page) 11.3.1 Internal vulnerability scans are performed asfollows: At least once every three months. Vulnerabilities that are either h igh-risk or critical(according to the entity's vulnerability riskrankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) areresolved. Rescans are performed that confirm all high-riskand all critical vulnerabilities (as noted above)have been resolved. Scan tool is kept up to date with latest vulnerability information. Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists. 11.3.1.a Examine internal scan report results fromthe last 12 months to verify that internal scans occurred at least once every three months in the most recent 12-month period.11.3.1.b Examine internal scan report results fromeach scan and rescan run in the last 12 months to verify that all high -risk vulnerabilities and all criticalvulnerabilities ( defined in PCI DSS Requirement6.3.1) are resolved.11.3.1.c Examine scan tool configurations andinterview personnel to verify that the scan tool is kept up to date with the latest vulnerability information.11.3.1.d Interview responsible personnel to verifythat the scan was performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified periodically using automated tools designed to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified based on a formal risk assessmentframework.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes DefinitionsA vulnerability scan is a combination ofautomated tools, techniques, and or methods run against external and internal devices and servers,designed to expose potential vulnerabilities inapplications , operating systems, and networkdevices that could be found and exploited by malicious individuals. It is not required to use a QSA or ASV to conductinternal vulnerability scans.Internal vulnerability scans can be performed by qualified, internal staff that are reasonablyindependent of the system component(s) beingscanned (for example, a network administrator should not be responsible for scanning the network), or an entity may choose to have internal vulnerability scans performed by a firm specializing in vulnerability scanning.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAll vulnerabilities, regardless of criticality, providea potential avenue of attack and must therefore be addressed periodically, with the vulnerabilitiesthat expose the most risk addressed more quicklyto limit the potential window of attack. 11.3.1.1 All other applicable vulnerabilities (thosenot ranked as high-risk vulnerabilities or criticalvulnerabilities according to the entity's vulnerabilityrisk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are managed as follows: Addressed based on the risk defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. Rescans are conducted as needed. 11.3.1.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis that defines the risk for addressing all other applicable vulnerabilities (those not rankedas high-risk vulnerabilities or critical vulnerabilitiesaccording to the entity's vulnerability risk rankingsat Requirement 6.3.1) to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.11.3.1.1.b Interview responsible personnel andexamine internal scan report results or other documentation to verify that all other applicable vulnerabilities (those not ranked as high-riskvulnerabilities or critical vulnerabilities according tothe entity's vulnerability risk rankings atRequirement 6.3.1) are addressed based on therisk defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, and that the scan process includes rescans as needed to confirm the vulnerabilities have been addressed. Customized Approach ObjectiveLower ranked vulnerabilities (lower than high-risk orcritical ) are addressed at a frequency in accordancewith the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThe timeframe for addressing lower -riskvulnerabilities is subject to the results of a risk analysis per Requirement 12.3.1 that includes (minimally) identification of assets being protected,threats, and likelihood and or impact of a threatbeing realized.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAuthenticated scanning provides greater insightinto an entity's vulnerability landscape since it can detect vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scanscannot detect. Attackers may leveragevulnerabilities that an entity is unaware of because certain vulnerabilities will only be detected with authenticated scanning.Authenticated scanning can yield significant additional information about an organization's vulnerabilities.Good PracticeThe credentials used for these scans should be considered highly privileged. They should be protected and controlled as such, following PCI DSS Requirements 7 and 8 (except for those requirements for multi-factor authentication andapplication and system accounts ). 11.3.1.2 Internal vulnerability scans are performedvia authenticated scanning as follows: Systems that are unable to accept credentialsfor authenticated scanning are documented. Sufficient privileges are used for those systemsthat accept credentials for scanning. If accounts used for authenticated scanning canbe used for interactive login, they are managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2. 11.3.1.2.a Examine scan tool configurations toverify that authenticated scanning is used for internal scans, with sufficient privileges, for thosesystems that accept credentials for scanning.11.3.1.2.b Examine scan report results andinterview personnel to verify that authenticated scans are performed.11.3.1.2.c If accounts used for authenticatedscanning can be used for interactive login,examine the accounts and interview personnel toverify the accounts are managed following allelements specified in Requirement 8.2.2. Customized Approach ObjectiveAutomated tools used to detect vulnerabilities can detect vulnerabilities local to each system, which are not visible remotely.11.3.1.2.d Examine documentation to verify thatsystems that are unable to accept credentials forauthenticated scanning are defined. Applicability NotesThe authenticated scanning tools can be either host-based or network -based.Sufficient privileges are those needed to access system resources such that a thorough scan can be conducted that detects known vulnerabilities.This requirement does not apply to systemcomponents that cannot accept credentials forscanning. Examples of systems that may not accept credentials for scanning include some network and security appliances, mainframes, and containers.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeScanning an environment after any significantchanges ensures that changes were completed appropriately such that the security of theenvironment was not compromised because ofthe change.Good PracticeEntities should perform scans after significant changes as part of the change process per Requirement 6.5.2 and before considering the change complete. All system components affected by the change will need to be scanned. 11.3.1.3 Internal vulnerability scans are performedafter any significant change as follows: Vulnerabilities that are either h igh-risk or critical(according to the entity's vulnerability riskrankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved. Rescans are conducted as needed. Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV ). 11.3.1.3.a Examine change control documentationand internal scan reports to verify that system components were scanned after any significantchanges.11.3.1.3.b Interview personnel and examineinternal scan and rescan reports to verify that internal scans were performed after significantchanges and that all high-risk vulnerabilities and allcritical vulnerabilities (defined in PCI DSSRequirement 6.3.1) were resolved.11.3.1.3.c Interview personnel to verify that internalscans are performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified following significant changes to the network or systems, by using automated tools designed to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the network.Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectifiedbased on a formal risk assessment framework.Applicability NotesAuthenticated internal vulnerability scanning perRequirement 11.3.1.2 is not required for scansperformed after significant changes.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAttackers routinely look for unpatched orvulnerable externally facing servers, which can be leveraged to launch a directed attack.Organizations must ensure these externally facingdevices are regularly scanned for weaknesses and that vulnerabilities are patched or remediated to protect the entity.Because external networks are at greater risk of compromise, external vulnerability scanning must be performed at least once every three months by a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).Good PracticeWhile scans are required at least once every three months, more frequent scans are recommended depending on the network complexity, frequency of change, and types of devices, software, and operating systems used.Vulnerabilities identified during externalvulnerability scans should be part of avulnerability management process that includes multiple vulnerability sources, as specified in Requirement 6.3.1.Multiple scan reports can be combined to show that all systems were scanned and that all applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of the three-month vulnerability scan cycle.However, additional documentation may berequired to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being resolved.Further InformationSee the ASV Program Guide on the PCI SSCwebsite. 11.3.2 External vulnerability scans are performed asfollows: At least once every three months. By a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). Vulnerabilities are resolved and ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan are met. Rescans are performed as needed to confirm that vulnerabilities are resolved per the ASV Program Guide requirements for a passingscan. 11.3.2.a Examine ASV scan reports from the last12 months to verify that external vulnerability scansoccurred at least once every three months in themost recent 12-month period.11.3.2.b Examine the ASV scan report from eachscan and rescan run in the last 12 months to verify that vulnerabilities are resolved and the ASVProgram Guide requirements for a passing scan are met.11.3.2.c Examine the ASV scan reports to verifythat the scans were completed by a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesFor the initial PCI DSS assessment against this requirement, it is not required that four passing scans be completed within 12 months if the assessor verifies: 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented policies and procedures requiring scanning at leastonce every three months, and 3) vulnerabilitiesnoted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-scan(s).(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceHowever, for subsequent years after the initial PCIDSS assessment, passing scans at least every threemonths must have occurred.ASV scanning tools can scan a vast array ofnetwork types and topologies. Any specifics aboutthe target environment (for example, load balancers, third-party providers, ISPs, specific configurations, protocols in use, scan interference) should be worked out between the ASV and scan customer.Refer to the ASV Program Guide published on thePCI SSC website for scan customer responsibilities, scan preparation, etc.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeScanning an environment after any significantchanges ensures that changes were completed appropriately such that the security of theenvironment was not compromised because ofthe change.Good PracticeEntities should include the need to perform scans after significant changes as part of the change process and before the change is considered complete. All system components affected by the change will need to be scanned. 11.3.2.1 External vulnerability scans are performedafter any significant change as follows: Vulnerabilities that are scored 4.0 or higher bythe CVSS are resolved. Rescans are conducted as needed. Scans are performed by qualified personnel andorganizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV ). 11.3.2.1.a Examine change control documentationand external scan reports to verify that system components were scanned after any significantchanges.11.3.2.1.b Interview personnel and examineexternal scan and rescan reports to verify that external scans were performed after significantchanges and that vulnerabilities scored 4.0 or higher by the CVSS were resolved.11.3.2.1.c Interview personnel to verify thatexternal scans are performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified following significant changes to the network or systems, by using tools designed to detectvulnerabilities operating from outside the network.Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified based on a formal risk assessment framework.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAttackers spend a lot of time finding external andinternal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtainaccess to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate that data. As such, entities need to test their networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do. This testing allows the entity to identify and remediate weakness that might be leveraged to compromise the entity's network and data, andthen to take appropriate actions to protect thenetwork and system components from such attacks.Good PracticePenetration testing techniques will differ based on an organization's needs and structure and should be suitable for the tested environment -forexample, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests might be appropriate. The type, depth, and complexity of the test ing will depend on thespecific environment and the needs of the organization.DefinitionsPenetration tests simulate a real-world attack situation intending to identify how far an attackercould penetrate an environment, given differingamounts of information provided to the tester. This allows an entity to better understand its potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploitingidentified vulnerabilities.(continued on next page) 11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined,documented, and implemented by the entity, andincludes: Industry -accepted penetration testingapproaches. Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems. Testing from both inside and outside the network. Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls. Application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4. Network -layer penetration tests that encompassall components that support network functions as well as operating systems. Review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months. Documented approach to assessing and addressing the risk posed by exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses foundduring penetration testing. Retention of penetration testing results andremediation activities results for at least 12 months. 11.4.1 Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify that the penetration-testing methodology defined, documented, and implemented by the entity includes all elements specified in this requirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not apenetration test, nor is a penetration test adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan.Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of thefirst steps, but i t is not the only step a penetrationtester will perform to plan the testing strategy. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.Penetration testing is a highly manual process.While some automated tools may be used, thetester uses their knowledge of systems to gain access into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with the goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a way to gain access to an application server, the tester will then usethe compromised server as a point to stage a newattack based on the resources to which the server has access. In this way, a tester can simulate thetechniques used by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. The testing of security monitoring and detection methods -for example, to confirm theeffectiveness of logging and file integritymonitoring mechanisms, should also beconsidered.(continued on next page) A formal methodology is defined for thorough technical testing that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities and security weaknesses viasimulated attack methods by a competent manualattacker.Applicability NotesTesting from inside the network (or internalpenetration testing) means testing from both insidethe CDE and into the CDE from trusted and untrusted internal networks.Testing from outside the network (or externalpenetration testing) means testing the exposed external perimeter of trusted networks, and critical systems connected to or accessible to public network infrastructures.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.4.1 (continued) Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: PenetrationTesting Guidance for additional guidance.Industry -accepted penetration testing approachesinclude:The Open Source Security Testing Methodologyand Manual (OSSTMM)Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) penetration testing programs.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeInternal penetration testing serves two purposes. Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to theinternal network, whether that is because theattacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity's perimeter.Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknownsystems. Additionally, it verifies the status ofmany of the controls operating within the CDE.A penetration test is not truly a test because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a pass or a fail. The best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity 11.4.2 Internal penetration testing is performed: Per the entity's defined methodology, At least once every 12 months After any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change By a qualified internal resource or qualified external third- party Organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV ). 11.4.2.a Examine the scope of work and resultsfrom the most recent internal penetration test to verify that penetration testing is performed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.4.2.b Interview personnel to verify that theinternal penetration test was performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party and that organizational independence ofthe tester exists (not required to be a QSA orASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveInternal system defenses are verified by technical testing according to the entity's defined methodology as frequently as needed to addressevolving and new attacks and threats and ensurethat significant changes do not introduce unknownvulnerabilities.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures did not know about , and the penetration testerfound them before an attacker could. Apenetration test that found nothing is typically indicative of shortcomings of the penetrationtester, rather than being a positive reflection ofthe security posture of the entity.Good PracticeSome considerations when choosing a qualified resource to perform penetration testing include: Specific penetration testing certifications, which may be an indication of the tester's skill level and competence. Prior experience conducting penetration testing -for example, the number of years ofexperience, and the type and scope of prior engagements can help confirm whether the tester's experience is appropriate for the needs of the engagement.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: PenetrationTesting Guidance on the PCI SSC website foradditional guidance. 11.4.3 External penetration testing is performed: Per the entity's defined methodology At least once every 12 months After any significant infrastructure or applicationupgrade or change By a qualified internal resource or qualifiedexternal third party Organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV ) 11.4.3.a Examine the scope of work and resultsfrom the most recent external penetration test to verify that penetration testing is performed according to all elements specified in thisrequirement.11.4.3.b Interview personnel to verify that theexternal penetration test was performed by aqualified internal resource or qualified external thirdparty and that organizational independence of thetester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveExternal system defenses are verified by technicaltesting according to the entity's definedmethodology as frequently as needed to address evolving and new attacks and threats, and to ensure that significant changes do not introduce unknownvulnerabilities.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe results of a penetration test are usually aprioritized list of vulnerabilities discovered by the exercise. Often a tester will have chained anumber of vulnerabilities together to compromisea system component. Remediating the vulnerabilities found by a penetration testsignificantly reduces the probability that the same vulnerabilities will be exploited by a malicious attacker.Using the entity's own vulnerability risk assessment process (see requirement 6.3.1)ensures that the vulnerabilities that pose thehighest risk to the entity will be remediated more quickly.Good PracticeAs part of the entity's assessment of risk, entities should consider how likely the vulnerability is to be exploited and whether there are other controlspresent in the environment to reduce the risk.Any weaknesses that point to PCI DSSrequirements not being met should be addressed. 11.4.4 Exploitable vulnerabilities and securityweaknesses found during penetration testing are corrected as follows: In accordance with the entity's assessment ofthe risk posed by the security issue as defined inRequirement 6.3.1. Penetration testing is repeated to verify the corrections. 11.4.4 Examine penetration testing results to verifythat noted exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses were corrected in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveVulnerabilities and security weaknesses found while verifying system defenses are mitigated.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWhen an entity uses segmentation controls toisolate the CDE from internal untrusted networks, the security of the CDE is dependent on thatsegmentation functioning. Many attacks haveinvolved the attacker moving laterally from what an entity deemed an isolated network into the CDE. Using penetration testing tools and techniques to validate that an untrusted network is indeed isolated from the CDE can alert the entity to a failure or misconfiguration of the segmentation controls, which can then berectified .Good PracticeTechniques such as host discovery and portscanning can be used to verify out -of-scopesegments have no access to the CDE. 11.4.5 If segmentation is used to isolate the CDEfrom other networks, penetration tests are performed on segmentation controls as follows: At least once every 12 months and after any changes to segmentation controls methods Covering all segmentation controls methods in use. According to the entity's defined penetration testing methodology. Confirming that the segmentationcontrols methods are operational and effective,and isolate the CDE from all out -of-scopesystems. Confirming effectiveness of any use of isolationto separate systems with differing security levels (see Requirement 2.2.3). Performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third party. Organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV ). 11.4.5.a Examine segmentation controls andreview penetration-testing methodology to verify that penetration-testing procedures are defined totest all segmentation methods in accordance withall elements specified in this requirement.11.4.5.b Examine the results from the most recentpenetration test to verify the penetration test covers and addresses all elements specified in this requirement.11.4.5.c Interview personnel to verify that the testwas performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveIf segmentation is used, it is verified periodically by technical testing to be continually effective, including after any changes, in isolating the CDE from all out -of-scope systems.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeService providers typically have access to greatervolumes of cardholder data or can provide an entry point that can be exploited to thencompromise multiple other entities. Serviceproviders also typically have larger and more complex networks that are su bject to morefrequent change. The probability of segmentation controls failing in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service-provider environments.Validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover such failings before they canbe exploited by an attacker attempting to pivotlaterally from an out -of-scope untrusted networkto the CDE.Good PracticeAlthough the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after significant change, this exerciseshould be performed as frequently as possible toensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE from o ther networks. 11.4.6 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: If segmentation is used to isolatethe CDE from other networks, penetration tests areperformed on segmentation controls as follows: At least once every six months and after anychanges to segmentation controls methods. Covering all segmentation controls methods in use. According to the entity's defined penetration testing methodology. Confirming that the segmentation controls methods are operational and effective, and isolate the CDE from all out -of-scopesystems. Confirming effectiveness of any use of isolation to separate systems with differing security levels (see Requirement 2.2.3). Performed by a qualified internal resource orqualified external third party. Organizational independence of the tester exists(not required to be a QSA or ASV ). 11.4.6.a Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinethe results from the most recent penetration test toverify that the penetration covers and addressed allelements specified in this requirement.11.4.6.b Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Interviewpersonnel to verify that the test was performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveIf segmentation is used, it is verified by technical testing to be continually effective, including after any changes, in isolating the CDE from out -of-scopesystems.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity beingassessed is a service provider.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEntities need to conduct penetration tests inaccordance with PCI DSS to simulate attacker behavior and discover vulnerabilities in theirenvironment. In shared and cloud environments,the multi -tenant service provider may beconcerned about the activities of a penetration tester affecting other customers' systems.Multi -tenant service providers cannot forbidpenetration testing because this would leave their customers' systems open to exploitation. Therefore, multi -tenant service providers mustsupport customer requests to conduct penetration testing or for penetration testing results. 11.4.7 Additional requirement for multi -tenantservice providers only: Multi -tenant serviceproviders support their customers for externalpenetration testing per Requirement 11.4.3 and11.4.4. 11.4.7 Additional testing procedure for multi -tenant service providers only: Examine evidenceto verify that multi -tenant service providers supporttheir customers for external penetration testing per Requirement 11.4.3 and 11.4.4.Customized Approach ObjectiveMulti -tenant service providers support theircustomers' need for technical testing either by providing access or evidence that comparabletechnical testing has been undertaken.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity beingassessed is a multi- tenant service provider.To meet this requirement, a multi -tenant serviceprovider may either: Provide evidence to its customers to show that penetration testing has been performed according to Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 on the customers' subscribed infrastructure, or Provide prompt access to each of its customers, so customers can perform their own penetrationtesting.Evidence provided to customers can includeredacted penetration testing results but needs to include sufficient information to prove that all elements of Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 have been met on the customer's behalf.Refer also to Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi -Tenant Service Providers .This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIntrusion- detection and or intrusion- preventiontechniques (such as IDS IPS) compare the trafficcoming into the network with known signatures and or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware), and then send alerts and or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach to detect unauthorized activity, attacks on (or misuse of)computer resources could go unnoticed for longperiods of time. The impact of an intrusion into the CDE is, in many ways, a factor of the time that an attacker has in the environment before being detected.Good PracticeSecurity alerts generated by these techniquesshould be continually monitored, so that theattempted or actual intrusions can be stopped, and potential damage limited.DefinitionsCritical locations could include, but are not limited to, network security controls between network segments (for example, between a DMZ and an internal network or between an in- scope and out -of-scope network) and points protectingconnections between a less trusted and a more trusted system component. 11.5.1 Intrusion-detection and or intrusion-prevention techniques are used to detect and or prevent intrusions into the network as follows: All traffic is monitored at the perimeter of the CDE. All traffic is monitored at critical points in the CDE. Personnel are alerted to suspected compromises. All intrusion -detection and prevention engines,baselines, and signatures are kept up to date. 11.5.1.a Examine system configurations andnetwork diagrams to verify that intrusion-detection and or intrusion-prevention techniques are in place to monitor all traffic: At the perimeter of the CDE. At critical points in the CDE.11.5.1.b Examine system configurations andinterview responsible personnel to verify intrusion-detection and or intrusion-prevention techniques alert personnel of suspected compromises.11.5.1.c Examine system configurations andvendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection and or intrusion-prevention techniques are configured to keep all engines, baselines, and signatures up to date.Customized Approach ObjectiveMechanisms to detect real -time suspicious oranomalous network traffic that may be indicative of threat actor activity are implemented. Alerts generated by these mechanisms are responded to by personnel, or by automated means that ensure that system compon ents cannot be compromised asa result of the detected activity.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeDetecting covert malware communicationattempts (for example, DNS tunneling) can help block the spread of malware laterally inside anetwork and the exfiltration of data. Whendeciding where to place this control, entities should consider critical locations in the network, and likely routes for covert channels.When malware establishes a foothold in an infected environment, it often tries to establish a communication channel to a command-and -control (C C) server. Through the C C server,the attacker communicates with and controlsmalware on compromised systems to delivermalicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will communicate with the C C server indirectly via botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls, and rendering these methods ineffective to detec tthe covert channels.(continued on next page)11.5.1.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Intrusion -detection and orintrusion -prevention techniques detect, alerton prevent, and address covert malware communication channels. 11.5.1.1.a Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinedocumentation and configuration settings to verifythat methods to detect and alert on prevent covertmalware communication channels are in place and operating.11.5.1.1.b Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinethe entity's incident -response plan (Requirement12.10.1) to verify it requires and defines a response in the event that covert malware communication channels are detected.11.5.1.1.c Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Interviewresponsible personnel and observe processes to verify that personnel maintain knowledge of covert malware communication and control techniques and are knowledgeable about how to respondwhen malware is suspected. Customized Approach ObjectiveMechanisms are in place to detect and alert preventcovert communications with command-and -controlsystems. Alerts generated by these mechanisms are responded to by personnel, or by automated means that ensure that such communications are blocked.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeMethods that can help detect and addressmalware communications channels include real-time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, anallow listing, data loss prevention tools, andnetwork security monitoring tools such as IDS IPS. Additionally, DNS queries andresponses are a key data source used by network defenders in support of incident response as well as intrusion discovery. When these transactions are collected for processing and analytics, they can enable a number of valuable security analyti cscenarios.It is important that organizations maintain up-to -date knowledge of malware modes of operation,as mitigating these can help detect and limit the impact of malware in the environment. This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeChanges to critical system, configuration, orcontent files can be an indicator an attacker has accessed an organization's system. Suchchanges can allow an attacker to take additionalmalicious actions, access cardholder data, and or conduct activities without detection or record.A change detection mechanism will detect and evaluate such changes to critical files and generate alerts that can be responded to following defined processes so that personnel can take appropriate actions.(continued on next page) 11.5.2 A change-detection mechanism (for example,file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows: To alert personnel to unauthorized modification(including changes, additions, and deletions) ofcritical files. To perform critical file comparisons at least once weekly. 11.5.2.a Examine system settings, monitored files,and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of a change- detection mechanism.11.5.2.b Examine settings for the change-detectionmechanism to verify it is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveCritical files cannot be modified by unauthorized personnel without an alert being generated.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes If not implemented properly and the output of thechange-detection solution monitored, a maliciousindividual could add, remove, or alter configuration file contents, operating systemprograms, or application executables.Unauthorized changes, if undetecte d, couldrender existing security controls ineffective and or result in cardholder data being stolen with no perceptible impact to normal processing.Good PracticeExamples of the types of files that should be monitored include, but are not limited to: System executables. Application executables. Configuration and parameter files. Centrally stored, historical, or archived auditlogs. Additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or othermeans).ExamplesChange- detection solutions such as file integritymonitoring (FIM) tools check for changes,additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify when such changes are detected. For change-detection purposes, critical files are usually those that do not regularly change, but the modification of which could indicate a systemcompromise or risk of compromise. Change-detection mechanisms such as file integrity monitoring products usually come pre-configured with critical files for the related operating system. Other critical files, such as those for custom applications , must be evaluated and defined by theentity (that is, the merchant or service provider).Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMany web pages now rely on assembling objects,including active content (primarily JavaScript), from multiple internet locations. Additionally, thecontent of many web pages is defined using content management and tag management systems that may not be possible to monitor using traditional change detection mechanisms.Therefore, the only place to detect changes orindicators of malicious activity is in the consumerbrowser as the page is constructed and all JavaScript interpreted.By comparing the current version of the HTTP header and the active content of payment pages as received by the consumer browser with prior or known versions, it is possible to detectunauthorized changes that may indicate askimming attack, or an attempt t o disable acontrol designed to protect against, or to detect, skimming attacks.Additionally, by looking for known indicators of compromise and script elements or behavior typical of skimmers, suspicious alerts can be raised.(continued on next page) 11.6.1 A change- and tamper -detection mechanismis deployed as follows: To alert personnel to unauthorized modification(including indicators of compromise, changes, additions, and deletions) to the security -impacting HTTP headers and the script contents of payment pages as received by the consumerbrowser. The mechanism is configured to evaluate thereceived HTTP headers and payment page s. The mechanism functions are performed as follows:- At least weeklyOR- Periodically (at the frequency defined in theentity's targeted risk analysis, which isperformed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1). 11.6.1.a Examine system settings, monitoredpayment pages, and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of a change- and tamper -detection mechanism.11.6.1.b Examine configuration settings to verifythe mechanism is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.6.1.c If the mechanism functions are performedat an entity -defined frequency, examine the entity'stargeted risk analysis for determining the frequency to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.11.6.1.d Examine configuration settings andinterview personnel to verify the mechanism functions are performed either: At least weeklyOR At the frequency defined in the entity's targetedrisk analysis performed for this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveE-commerce skimming code or techniques cannotbe added to payment pages as received by the consumer browser without a timely alert being generated. Anti -skimming measures cannot beremoved from payment pages without a prompt alertbeing generated.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeWhere an entity includes a TPSP's paymentprocessor's embedded payment page form on itswebpage, the entity should expect theTPSP payment processor to provide evidence thatthe TPSP payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordance with theTPSP's payment processor's PCI DSS assessmentand Requirement 12.9.ExamplesMechanisms that detect and report on changes to the headers and content of the payment page couldinclude, but are not limited to, a combination of thefollowing techniques: Violations of the Content Security Policy (CSP)can be reported to the entity using the report- toor report -uri CSP directives. Changes to the CSP itself can indicatetampering. External monitoring by systems that request andanalyze the received web pages (also known assynthetic user monitoring) can detect changes toJavaScript in payment pages and alertpersonnel. Embedding tamper -resistant, tamper -detectionscript in the payment page can alert and blockwhen malicious script behavior is detected. Reverse proxies and Content Delivery Networkscan detect changes in scripts and alertpersonnel.The above list of mechanisms is not exhaustive, and the use of any one mechanism is not necessarily afull detection and reporting mechanism.Often, these mechanisms are subscription or cloud -based, but can also be based on custom and bespoke solutions. This requirement also applies to entities with awebpage (s) that includes a TPSP's paymentprocessor's embedded payment page form (forexample, one or more inline frames or iframes.)This requirement does not apply to an entity for scripts in a TPSP's payment processor's embedded paymentpage form (for example, one or more iframes), where the entity includes a TPSP's payment processor'spayment page form on its webpage.Scripts in the TPSP's payment processor's embedded payment page form are the responsibility of theTPSP payment processor to manage in accordance with this requirement.The intention of this requirement is not that an entity installs software in the systems or browsers of itsconsumers, but rather that the entity uses techniquessuch as those described under Examples in the Guidance column to prevent and detect unexpectedscript activities.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fullyconsidered during a PCI DSS assessment.Maintain an Information Security PolicyRequirement 12: Support I nformation Security with O rganizational Policies and ProgramsSections12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity's information as sets is knownand current.12.2 Acceptable use policies for end- user technologies are defined and implemented.12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third- party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.12.9 Third -party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers' PCI DSS compliance.12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.OverviewThe organization's overall information security policy sets the tone for the whole entity and informs personnel what is expected of them. Allpersonnel should be aware of the sensitivity of cardholder data and their responsibilities for protecting it.For the purposes of Requirement 12, personnel refers to full -time and part -time employees, temporary employees, contractors, andconsultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity's information assets isknown and current.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn organization's overall information securitypolicy ties to and governs all other policies and procedures that define protection of cardholder data.The information security policy communicates management's intent and objectives regarding the protection of its most valuable assets, including cardholder data.Without an information security policy, individuals will make their own value decisions on the controls that are required within the organizationwhich may result in the organization neithermeeting its legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, nor being able to adequately protect its assets in a consistent manner.To ensure the policy is implemented, it is important that all relevant personnel within the organization, as well as relevant third parties, vendors, and business partners are aware of theorganization's information security policy and theirresponsibiliti es for protecting information assets.(continued on next page) 12.1.1 An overall information security policy is: Established. Published. Maintained. Disseminated to all relevant personnel, as well as to relevant vendors and business partners. 12.1.1 Examine the information security policy andinterview personnel to verify that the overall information security policy is managed inaccordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe strategic objectives and principles of information security are defined, adopted, and known to all personnel.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.1.1 (continued) Good PracticeThe security policy for the organization identifiesthe purpose, scope, accountability, andinformation that clearly defines the organization's position regarding information security.The overall information security policy differs from individual security policies that address specifictechnology or security disciplines. This policy setsforth the directives for the entire organization whereas individual security policies align and support the overall security policy and communicate specific objectives for technology or security disciplines.It is important that all relevant personnel withinthe organization, as well as relevant third parties,vendors, and business partners are aware of the organization's information security policy and their responsibilities for protecting information assets.DefinitionsRelevant for this requirement means that the information security policy is disseminated to those with roles applicable to some or all thetopics in the policy, either within the company orbecause of services functions performed by a vendor or third par ty.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSecurity threats and associated protectionmethods evolve rapidly. Without updating the information security policy to reflect relevant changes, new measures to defend against these threats may not be addressed. 12.1.2 The information security policy is: Reviewed at least once every 12 months. Updated as needed to reflect changes to business objectives or risks to the environment. 12.1.2 Examine the information security policy andinterview responsible personnel to verify the policy is managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe information security policy continues to reflect the organization's strategic objectives and principles.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout clearly defined security roles and responsibilities assigned, there could be misuse of the organization's information assets or inconsistent interaction with information security personnel, leading to insecure implementation oftechnologies or use of outdated or insecu retechnologies. 12.1.3 The security policy clearly definesinformation security roles and responsibilities for all personnel, and all personnel are aware of andacknowledge their information security responsibilities. 12.1.3.a Examine the information security policy toverify that they clearly define information securityroles and responsibilities for all personnel.12.1.3.b Interview personnel in various roles toverify they understand their information security responsibilities.12.1.3.c Examine documented evidence to verifypersonnel acknowledge their information security responsibilities.Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel understand their role in protecting the entity's cardholder data.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTo ensure someone with sufficient authority andresponsibility is actively managing and championing the organization's information security program, accountability and responsibility for information security needs to be assigned at the executive level within an organization.Good PracticeThese executive management positions are oftenat the most senior level of management and arepart of the chief executive level or C -level,typically reporting to the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. Information securityknowledge for this executive management rolecan be indicated by work experience, education, and or relevant professional certifications . Theexpectation is that this individual can provide assurance about the implementation of an effective security program and ensure the right technical experts are employed.Entities should also consider transition and or succession plans for these key personnel to avoidpotential gaps in critical security activities. 12.1.4 Responsibility for information security isformally assigned to a Chief Information SecurityOfficer or other information security knowledgeable member of executive management. . 12.1.4 Examine the information security policy toverify that information security is formally assigned to a Chief Information Security Officer or other information security -knowledgeable member ofexecutive management.Customized Approach ObjectiveA designated member of executive management is responsible for information security.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.2 Acceptable use policies for end -user technologies are defined and implemented.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEnd-user technologies are a significantinvestment and may pose significant risk to an organization if not managed properly. Acceptableuse policies outline the expected behavior frompersonnel when using the organization's information technology and reflect the organization's risk toleranceThese policies instruct personnel on what they can and cannot do with company equipment and instruct personnel on correct and incorrect uses ofcompany Internet and email resources. Suchpolicies can legally protect an organization and allow it to act when the policies are violated.Good PracticeIt is important that usage policies are supported by technical controls to manage the enforcement of the policies.Structuring polices as simple do and do notrequirements that are linked to a purpose canhelp remove ambiguity and provide personnel with the context for the requirement. 12.2.1 Acceptable use policies for end-usertechnologies are documented and implemented,including: Explicit approval by authorized parties. Acceptable uses of the technology. List of products approved by the company foremployee use, including hardware and software. 12.2.1 Examine the acceptable use policies forend-user technologies and interview responsiblepersonnel to verify processes are documented andimplemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe use of end -user technologies is defined andmanaged to ensure authorized usage.Applicability NotesExamples of end- user technologies for whichacceptable use policies are expected include, butare not limited to, remote access and wireless technologies, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and removable electronic media, email usage, andInternet usage.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSome PCI DSS requirements allow an entity todefine how frequently an activity is performed based on the risk to the entity's environment.Performing this risk analysis according to a methodology ensures validity and consistency with policies and procedures .This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment) focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that allow an entity flexibility about how frequently anentity performs a given control. For this riskanalysis, the entity car efully evaluates each PCIDSS requirement that provides this flexibility and determines the frequency that supports adequate security for the entity , and the level of risk theentity is willing to accept.The risk analysis identifies the specific assets, such as the system components and data-forexample, log files, or credentials -that therequirement is intended to protect, as well as thethreat(s) or outcomes that the requirement is protecting the assets from -for example,malware, an undetected intruder, or misuse of credentials. Examples of factors that could contribute to likelihood or impact include any thatcould increase the vulnerability of an asset to athreat -for example, exposure to untrustednetw orks, complexity of environment, or high staffturnover -as well as the criticality of the systemcomponents, or volume and sensitivity of the data, being protected.(continued on next page) 12.3.1 For each PCI DSS requirement that specifiescompletion of a targeted risk analysis , the analysisis documented and includes: Identification of the assets being protected. Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against. Identification of factors that contribute to the likelihood and or impact of a threat being realized. Resulting analysis that determines, and includesjustification for, how the frequency or processesdefined by the entity to meet the requirementminimize the likelihood and or impact of thethreat being realized. Review of each targeted risk analysis at leastonce every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated riskanalysis is needed. Performance of updated risk analyses whenneeded, as determined by the annual review. 12.3.1 Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify a process is defined forperforming targeted risk analyses for each PCIDSS requirement that specifies completion of a targeted risk analysis , and that the processincludes all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveUp to date knowledge and assessment of risks tothe CDE are maintained.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.3.1 (continued) Reviewing the results of these targeted riskanalyses at least once every 12 months and upon changes that could impact the risk to the environment allows the organization to ensure the risk analysis results remain current with organizational changes and evolving threats, trends, and technologies, and that the selectedfrequencies still adequately address the entity'srisk.Good PracticeAn enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a point -in-time activity that enables entities toidentify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is recommended, but is not required, for entities todetermine and understand broader and emergingthreats with the potential to negatively impact its business. This enterprise-wide risk assessment could be established as part of an overarching risk management program that is used as an input to the annual review of an organization's overall information security pol icy (seeRequirement 12.1.1).Examples of risk -assessment methodologies forenterprise-wide risk assessments include, but are not limited to, ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800 -30.Further InformationRefer to the following documents on the PCI SSCwebsite: Information Supplement: TRA Guidance Sample Template: TRA for Activity Frequency .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA risk analysis following a repeatable and robustmethodology enables an entity to meet the customized approach objective.DefinitionsThe customized approach to meeting a PCI DSS requirement allows entities to define the controlsused to meet a given requirement's statedCustomized Approach O bjective in a way thatdoes not strictly follow the defined requirement .These controls are expected to at least meet or exceed the security provided by the defined requirement and require extensive documentation by the entity using the customized approach.Further InformationSee Appendix D : Customized Approach forinstructions on how to document the required evidence for the customized approach.See PCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to SupportCustomized Approach on the PCI SSC websitefor templates that entities may use to document their customized controls. Note that while use ofthe templates is optional, the information specifiedwithin each template must be documented and provided to each entity's assessor. 12.3.2 A targeted risk analysis is performed for eachPCI DSS requirement that the entity meets with the customized approach, to include: Documented evidence detailing each element specified in Appendix D: Customized Approach(including, at a minimum, a controls matrix andrisk analysis). Approval of documented evidence by senior management. Performance of the targeted analysis of risk at least once every 12 months. 12.3.2 Examine the documented targeted risk -analysis for each PCI DSS requirement that the entity meets with the customized approach to verify that documentation for each requirement exists and is in accordance with all elements specified inthis requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is part of the customized approachand must be met for those using the customized approach.Applicability NotesThis requirement only applies to entities using a Customized Approach.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeProtocols and encryption strengths may quicklychange or be deprecated due to identification of vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support current and future data security needs, entities need to know where cryptography is used and understand how they would be able to respondrapidly to changes impacting the strength of their cryptographic implementations. Good PracticeCryptographic agility is important to ensure an alternative to the original encryption method or cryptographic primitive is available, with plans to upgrade to the alternative without significant change to system infrastructure. For example, ifthe entity is aware of when protocols oralgorithms will be deprecated by standards bodies, proactive plans will help the entity toupgrade before the deprecation is impactful to operations.DefinitionsCryptographic agility refers to the ability to monitor and manage the encryption and relatedverification technologies deployed across anorganization.Further InformationRefer to NIST SP 800 -131a, Transitioning theUse of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths . 12.3.3 Cryptographic cipher suites and protocols inuse are documented and reviewed at least onceevery 12 months, including at least the following: An up-to -date inventory of all cryptographiccipher suites and protocols in use, includingpurpose and where used. Active monitoring of industry trends regarding continued viability of all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use. Documentation of a plan, to respond toanticipated changes in cryptographic vulnerabilities. 12.3.3 Examine documentation for cryptographicsuites and protocols in use and interview personnel to verify the documentation and review is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity is able to respond quickly to anyvulnerabilities in cryptographic protocols or algorithms, where those vulnerabilities affect protection of cardholder data.Applicability NotesThe requirement applies to all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols used to meet PCI DSSrequirements , including, but not limited to, thoseused to render PAN unreadable in storage and transmission, to protect passwords, and as part ofauthenticating access .This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHardware and software technologies areconstantly evolving, and organizations need to be aware of changes to the technologies they use, as well as the evolving threats to those technologies to ensure that they can prepare for, and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware andsoftware that will not be remediated by the vendoror developer. Good PracticeOrganizations should review firmware versions to ensure they remain current and supported by the vendors. Organizations also need to be aware of changes made by technology vendors to their products or processes to understand how suchchanges may impact the organization's use of thetechnology.Regular reviews of technologies that impact or influence PCI DSS controls can assist with purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies, and ensure controls that rely on those technologies remain effective. These reviews include, but are not limited to, rev iewingtechnologies that are no longer supported by the vendor and or no longer meet the security needs of the organization. 12.3.4 Hardware and software technologies in useare reviewed at least once every 12 months, including at least the following: Analysis that the technologies continue to receive security fixes from vendors promptly. Analysis that the technologies continue to support (and do not preclude) the entity's PCI DSS compliance. Documentation of any industry announcements or trends related to a technology, such as when a vendor has announced end of life plans for a technology. Documentation of a plan, approved by seniormanagement, to remediate outdatedtechnologies, including those for which vendors have announced end of life plans. 12.3.4 Examine documentation for the review ofhardware and software technologies in use and interview personnel to verify that the review is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity's hardware and software technologies are up to date and supported by the vendor. Plans toremove or replace all unsupported system components are reviewed periodically.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeExecutive management assignment of PCI DSScompliance responsibilities ensures executive -level visibility into the PCI DSS complianceprogram and allows for the opportunity to askappropriate questions to determine the effectiveness of the program and influence strategic priorities. 12.4.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Responsibility is established byexecutive management for the protection of cardholder data and a PCI DSS compliance program to include: Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSScompliance. Defining a charter for a PCI DSS compliance program and communication to executive management. 12.4.1 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Examinedocumentation to verify that executive management has established responsibility for the protection of cardholder data and a PCI DSS compliance program in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveExecutives are responsible and accountable forsecurity of cardholder data.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.Executive management may include C -levelpositions, board of directors, or equivalent. The specific titles will depend on the particular organizational structure.Responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program may be assigned to individual roles and or to business units within the organization.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegularly confirming that security policies andprocedures are being followed provides assurance that the expected controls are active and working as intended. This requirement is distinct from other requirements that specify a task to be performed. The objective of thesereviews is not to reperform other PCI DSSrequirements, but to confirm that securityactivities are being performed on an ongoing basis .Good PracticeThese reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained-forexample, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,reviews of network security control rulesets -toassist in the entity's preparation for its next PCIDSS assessment.ExamplesLooking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example, Requirement 12.4.2 is met by confirming, at least once every three months, that reviews ofconfigurations of network security controls haveoccurred at the required frequency. On the other hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing those configurations as specified in the requirement . 12.4.2 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Reviews are performed at leastonce every three months to confirm that personnelare performing their tasks in accordance with all security policies and operational procedures .Reviews are performed by personnel other thanthose responsible for performing the given task and include, but are not limited to , the following tasks: Daily log reviews. Configuration reviews for network security controls. Applying configuration standards to new systems. Responding to security alerts. Change- management processes. 12.4.2.a Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinepolicies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for conducting reviews to confirm thatpersonnel are performing their tasks in accordancewith all security policies and all operationalprocedures, including but not limited to the tasks specified in this requirement.12.4.2.b Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Interviewresponsible personnel and examine records of reviews to verify that reviews are performed: At least once every three months. By personnel other than those responsible for performing the given task.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe operational effectiveness of critical PCI DSScontrols is verified periodically by manual inspection of records.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe intent of these independent checks is toconfirm whether security activities are being performed on an ongoing basis. These reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained -for example, auditlogs, vulnerability scan reports, reviews ofnetwork security control rulesets -to assist in theentity's preparation for its next PCI DSS assessment. 12.4.2.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Reviews conducted in accordancewith Requirement 12.4.2 are documented to include: Results of the reviews. Documented remediation actions taken for anytasks that were found to not be performed atRequirement 12.4.2. Review and sign-off of results by personnel assigned responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program. 12.4.2.1 Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinedocumentation from the reviews conducted in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.4.2 to verify the documentation includes all elementsspecified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveFindings from operational effectiveness reviews areevaluated by management; appropriate remediation activities are implemented.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMaintaining a current list of all systemcomponents will enable an organization to definethe scope of its environment and implement PCIDSS requirements accurately and efficiently.Without an inventory, some system components could be overlooked and be inadvertently excluded from the organization's configurationstandards.Good PracticeIf an entity keeps an inventory of all assets, thosesystem components in scope for PCI DSS shouldbe clearly identifiable among the other assets.Inventories should include containers or images that may be instantiated.Assigning an owner to the inventory helps to ensure the inventory stays current.ExamplesMethods to maintain an inventory include as adatabase, as a series of files, or in an inventory -management tool. 12.5.1 An inventory of system components that arein scope for PCI DSS, including a description of function use, is maintained and kept current. 12.5.1.a Examine the inventory to verify it includesall in-scope system components and a descriptionof function use for each.12.5.1.b Interview personnel to verify the inventoryis kept current.Customized Approach ObjectiveAll system components in scope for PCI DSS areidentified and known.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFrequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps toensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.Good PracticeAccurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in -scope sy stems are appropriately secured.When documenting account data locations, theentity can consider creating a table orspreadsheet that includes the following information: Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including the purpose of data storage and theretention period, Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry date, cardholder name, and or any elementsof SAD prior to completion of authorization), How data is secured (type of encryption andstrength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization), How access to data stores is logged ,including a description of loggingmechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution,application level, operating system level,etc.).(continued on next page) 12.5.2 PCI DSS scope is documented andconfirmed by the entity at least once every 12 months and upon significant change to the in-scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes: Identifying all data flows for the various payment stages (for example, authorization, capture settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and acceptance channels (for example, card-present, card- not-present, and e-commerce). Updating all data -flow diagrams perRequirement 1.2.4. Identifying all locations where account data isstored, processed, and transmitted, including butnot limited to: 1) any locations outside of the currently defined CDE, 2) applications thatprocess CHD, 3) transmissions betweensystems and networks, and 4) file backups. Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impactsecurity of the CDE. Identifying all segmentation controls in use and the environment(s) from which the CDE is segmented, including justification for environments being out of scope. Identifying all connections from third-party entities with access to the CDE. Confirming that all identified data flows, accountdata, system components, segmentationcontrols, and connections from third parties with access to the CDE are included in scope. 12.5.2.a Examine documented results of scopereviews and interview personnel to verify that the reviews are performed: At least once every 12 months. After significant changes to the in- scopeenvironment.12.5.2.b Examine documented results of scopereviews performed by the entity to verify that PCI DSS scoping confirmation activity includes allelements specified in this requirement.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceCustomized Approach Objective In addition to internal systems and networks, allconnections from third -party entities -forexample, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers -need to be identified to determineinclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in- scopeconnections have been identified, the applicablePCI DSS controls can be implemented to reducethe risk of a third-party connection being used to compromise an entity's CDE.A data discovery tool or methodology can be used to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDEor in unexpected places within the defined CDE -for example, in an error log or memory dump file.This approach can help ensure that previously unknown locations of PAN are detected and that the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.Further InformationFor additional guidance, r efer to InformationSupplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping andNetwork Segmentation. PCI DSS scope is verified periodically, and aftersignificant changes, by comprehensive analysis and appropriate technical measures.Applicability NotesThis annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is an activity expected to be performed by the entity under assessment, and is not the same, nor is itintended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmationperformed by the entity's assessor during theannual assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeService providers typically have access to greatervolumes of cardholder data than do merchants, orcan provide an entry point that can be exploited to then compromise multiple other entities. Service providers also typically have larger and more complex networks that are subject to morefrequent change. The probability of overlookedchanges to scope in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service- providersenvironments.Validating PCI DSS scope more frequently is likely to discover such overlooked changes before they can be exploited by an attacker. 12.5.2.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: PCI DSS scope is documented andconfirmed by the entity at least once every six months and upon significant change to the in-scopeenvironment . At a minimum, the scoping validationincludes all the elements specified in Requirement 12.5.2. 12.5.2.1.a Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinedocumented results of scope reviews and interview personnel to verify that reviews per Requirement 12.5.2 are performed: At least once every six months, and After significant changes12.5.2.1.b Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinedocumented results of scope reviews to verify that scoping validation includes all elements specified in Requirement 12.5.2. Customized Approach ObjectiveThe accuracy of PCI DSS scope is verified to be continuously accurate by comprehensive analysis and appropriate technical measures.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn organization's structure and managementdefine the requirements and protocol for effective and secure operations. Changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported PCI DSS controlsor inheriting new responsibilities that may nothave established controls in place. Therefore, it is important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls when there are changes to an organization's structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active.ExamplesChanges to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security controls. 12.5.3 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: Significant changes toorganizational structure result in a documented(internal) review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls, with resultscommunicated to executive management. 12.5.3.a Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinepolicies and procedures to verify that processesare defined such that a significant change to organizational structure results in documentedreview of the impact to PCI DSS scope andapplicability of controls.12.5.3.b Additional testing procedure forservice provider assessments only: Examinedocumentation (for example, meeting minutes) and interview responsible personnel to verify that significant changes to organizational structure resulted in documented reviews that included all elements specified in this requirement, with results communicated to executive management. Customized Approach ObjectivePCI DSS scope is confirmed after significant organizational change.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf personnel are not educated about theircompany's information security policies and procedures and their own security responsibilities,security safeguards and processes that havebeen implemented may become ineffectivethrough unintentional errors or intentional actions. 12.6.1 A formal security awareness program isimplemented to make all personnel aware of theentity's information security policy and procedures ,and their role in protecting the cardholder data. 12.6.1 Examine the security awareness program toverify it provides awareness to all personnel about the entity's information security policy andprocedures , and personnel's role in protecting thecardholder data.Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel are knowledgeable about the threat landscape, their responsibility for the operation ofrelevant security controls, and are able to accessassistance and guidance when required.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe threat environment and an entity's defensesare not static. As such, the security awarenessprogram materials must be updated as frequentlyas needed to ensure that the education received by personnel is up to date and represents thecurrent threat environment . 12.6.2 The security awareness program is: Reviewed at least once every 12 months, and Updated as needed to address any new threats and vulnerabilities that may impact the security of the entity's cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data, or the information providedto personnel about their role in protecting cardholder data. 12.6.2 Examine security awareness programcontent, evidence of reviews, and interview personnel to verify that the security awareness program is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe content of security awareness material isreviewed and updated periodically.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTraining of personnel ensures they receive theinformation about the importance of informationsecurity and that they understand their role inprotecting the organization.Requiring an acknowledgment by personnel helpsensure that they have read and understood thesecurity policies and procedures, and that theyhave made and will continue to make a commitment to comply with these policies.Good PracticeEntities may incorporate new -hire training as partof the Human Resources onboarding process. Training should outline the security -related dosand don'ts. Periodic refresher training reinforces key security processes and procedures that may be forgotten or bypassed.Entities should consider requiring security awareness training anytime personnel transfer into roles where they can impact the security ofcardholder data and or sensitive authentication data from roles where they did not have thisimpact .Methods and training content can vary, depending on personnel roles.ExamplesDifferent methods that can be used to provide security awareness and education include posters, letters, web-based training, in -persontraining, team meetings, and incentives.Personnel acknowledgment s may be recorded inwriting or electronically. 12.6.3 Personnel receive security awarenesstraining as follows: Upon hire and at least once every 12 months. Multiple methods of communication are used. Personnel acknowledge at least once every 12months that they have read and understood theinformation security policy and procedures. 12.6.3.a Examine security awareness programrecords to verify that personnel attend security awareness training upon hire and at least once every 12 months.12.6.3.b Examine security awareness programmaterials to verify the program includes multiple methods of communicating awareness and educating personnel.12.6.3.c Interview personnel to verify they havecompleted awareness training and are aware of their role in protecting cardholder data.12.6.3.d Examine security awareness programmaterials and personnel acknowledgment s toverify that personnel acknowledge at least once every 12 months that they have read andunderstand the information security policy andprocedures. Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel remain knowledgeable about the threat landscape, their responsibility for the operation of relevant security controls, and are able to access assistance and guidance when required.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEducating personnel on how to detect, react to,and report potential phishing and related attacksand social engineering attempts is essential tominimizing the probability of successful attac ks.Good PracticeAn effective security awareness program shouldinclude examples of phishing emails and periodic testing to determine the prevalence of personnel reporting such attacks. Training material an entity can consider for this topic include: How to identify phishing and other social engineering attacks. How to react to suspected phishing and socialengineering. Where and how to report suspected phishingand social engineering activity.An emphasis on reporting allows the organization to reward positive behavior, to optimize technical defenses (see Requirement 5.4.1), and to take immediate action to remove similar phishing emails that evaded technical defenses fromrecipient inboxes. 12.6.3.1 Security awareness training includesawareness of threats and vulnerabilities that couldimpact the security of cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data , including but notlimited to: Phishing and related attacks. Social engineering. 12.6.3.1 Examine security awareness trainingcontent to verify it includes all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel are knowledgeable about their own human vulnerabilities and how threat actors will attempt to exploit such vulnerabilities. Personnel are able to access assistance and guidance when required.Applicability NotesSee Requirement 5.4.1 for guidance on the difference between technical and automated controls to detect and protect users from phishing attacks, and this requirement for providing users security awareness training about phishing andsocial engineering . These are two separate anddistinct requirements, and one is not met by implementing controls required by the other one.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeBy including the key points of the acceptable usepolicy in regular training and the related context, personnel will understand their responsibilities and how these impact the security of an organization's systems. 12.6.3.2 Security awareness training includesawareness about the acceptable use of end- usertechnologies in accordance with Requirement 12.2.1 . 12.6.3.2 Examine security awareness trainingcontent to verify it includes awareness about acceptable use of end-user technologies in accordance with Requirement 12.2.1.Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel are knowledgeable about their responsibility for the security and operation of end-user technologies and are able to access assistanceand guidance when required.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePerforming thorough screening prior to hiringpotential personnel who are expected to be given access to the CDE provides entities with theinformation necessary to make informed risk decisions regarding personnel they hire that will have access to the CDE .Other benefits of screening potential personnel include helping to ensure workplace safety and confirming information provided by prospective employees on their resumes.Good PracticeEntities should consider screening for existing personnel anytime they transfer into roles where they have access to the CDE from roles where they did not have this access.To be effective, the level of screening should beappropriate for the position. For example, positions requiring greater responsibility or thathave administrative access to critical data orsystems may warrant more detailed or morefrequent screening than positions with less responsibility and access.ExamplesScreening options can include, as appropriate for the entity's region, previous employment history,review of public information social media resources , criminal record, credit history, andreference checks. 12.7.1 Potential personnel who will have access tothe CDE are screened, within the constraints oflocal laws, prior to hire to minimize the risk ofattacks from internal sources. 12.7.1 Interview responsible Human Resourcedepartment management to verify that screening isconducted, within the constraints of local laws,prior to hiring potential personnel who will have access to the CDE.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe risk related to allowing new members of staff access to the CDE is understood and managed.Applicability NotesFor those potential personnel to be hired forpositions such as store cashiers, who only haveaccess to one card number at a time when facilitating a transaction, this requirement is a recommendation only.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third -party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMaintaining a list of all TPSPs identifies wherepotential risk extends outside the organization and defines the organization's extended attacksurface.ExamplesDifferent types of TPSPs include those that: Store, process, or transmit account data onthe entity's behalf ( such as paymentgateways, payment processors, payment service providers (PSPs), and off -site storageproviders ). Manage system components included in the entity's PCI DSS assessment ( such asproviders of network security control services, anti-malware services, and security incidentand event management (SIEM); contact and call centers; web- hosting companies; andIaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS cloudproviders). Could impact the security of the entity's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data ( such as vendorsproviding support via remote access, andbespoke software developers). 12.8.1 A list of all third -party service providers(TPSPs) with which account data is shared or thatcould affect the security of account data is maintained, including a description for each of the services provided. 12.8.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined to maintain a list ofTPSPs, including a description for each of theservices provided, for all TPSPs with whom account data is shared or that could affect the security of account data.12.8.1.b Examine documentation to verify that alist of all TPSPs is maintained that includes a description of the services provided.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords are maintained of TPSPs and the services provided.Applicability NotesThe use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the entity's responsibility for its own PCIDSS compliance.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe written acknowledgment from a TPSPdemonstrates its commitment to maintainingproper security of account data that it obtainsfrom its customers and that the TPSP is fully aware of the assets that could be affected during the provisioning of the TPSP's service. The extentto which a specific TPSP is responsible for the security of account data will depend on the service provided and the responsibilities agreedbetween the provider and assessed entity (thecustomer).In conjunction with Requirement 12.9.1, this requirement is intended to promote a consistentlevel of understanding between parties about theirapplicable PCI DSS responsibilities. For example, the agreement may include the applicable PCI DSS requirements to be maintained as part of theprovided service. 12.8.2 Written agreements with TPSPs aremaintained as follows: Written agreements are maintained with all TPSPs with which account data is shared or that could affect the security of the CDE. Written agreements include acknowledgment sfrom TPSPs that TPSPs are responsible for thesecurity of account data the TPSPs possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the entity, or to the extent that the TPSP couldimpact the security of the entity's cardholder data and or sensitive authentication data. 12.8.2.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined to maintain written agreements with all TPSPs in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.12.8.2.b Examine written agreements with TPSPsto verify they are maintained in accordance with all elements as specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords are maintained of each TPSP's acknowledgment of its responsibility to protectaccount data.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes Good PracticeThe entity may also want to consider including intheir written agreement with a TPSP that the TPSP will support the entity's request for information per Requirement 12.9.2. Entities will also want to understand whether any TPSPs have nested relationships with other TPSPs, meaningthe primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s)for the purposes of providing a service.It is important to understand whether the primary TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overall compliance of a service, and what types of written agreements the primary TPSP has in place with the secondary TPSPs. Entitiescan consider including coverage in their writtenagreement for any nested TPSPs a primary TPSP may use.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: Third-PartySecurity Assurance for further guidance. The exact wording of an agreement will depend onthe details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. The agreement does not have to include the exactwording provided in this requirement.The TPSP's written acknowledgment is aconfirm ation that states the TPSP is responsible forthe security of the account data it may store, process , or transmit on behalf of the customer or tothe extent the TPSP may impact the security of acustomer's cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data.Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSSrequirements (is not the same as a writtenacknowledgment specified in this requirement. Forexample, a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC ), a declaration on a company's website, apolicy statement, a responsibility matrix, or other evidence not included in a written agreement is nota written acknowledgment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA thorough process for engaging TPSPs,including details for selection and vetting prior toengagement, helps ensure that a TPSP is thoroughly vetted internally by an entity prior to establishing a formal relationship and that the risk to cardholder data associated with theengagement of the TPSP is understood.Good PracticeSpecific due- diligence processes and goals willvary for each organization. Elements that shouldbe considered include the provider's reporting practices, breach-notification and incident response procedures, details of how PCI DSSresponsibilities are ass igned between each party,how the TPSP validates their PCI DSScompliance and what evidence they provide. 12.8.3 An established process is implemented forengaging TPSPs, including proper due diligence prior to engagement. 12.8.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for engaging TPSPs, including proper due diligence prior to engagement.12.8.3.b Examine evidence and interviewresponsible personnel to verify the process for engaging TPSPs includes proper due diligence prior to engagement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe capability, intent, and resources of a prospective TPSP to adequately protect account data are assessed before the TPSP is engaged.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeKnowing the PCI DSS compliance status of allengaged TPSPs provides assurance and awarenessabout whether they comply with the requirementsapplicable to the services they offer to theorganization.Good PracticeIf the TPSP offers a variety of services, thecompliance status the entity monitors should be specific to those services delivered to the entity andthose services in scope for the entity's PCI DSSassessment.(continued on next page) 12.8.4 A program is implemented to monitor TPSPs'PCI DSS compliance status at least once every 12months. 12.8.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined to monitor TPSPs' PCI DSS compliance status at least once every 12months.12.8.4.b Examine documentation and interviewresponsible personnel to verify that the PCI DSScompliance status of each TPSP is monitored at leastonce every 12 months. Customized Approach ObjectiveThe PCI DSS compliance status of TPSPs is verified periodically.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability Notes If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation ofCompliance ( AOC ), the expectation is that theTPSP should provide that to customers uponrequest to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance status.If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS assessment, it may be able to provide othersufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has metthe applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity's assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demandassessments by each of its customers' assessors,with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met.Further InformationFor more information about third-party service providers, refer to : PCI DSS section: Use of Third -Party ServiceProviders. Information Supplement: Third -Party SecurityAssurance. Where an entity has an agreement with a TPSP for meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the entity (for example, via a firewall service), the entity must work with the TPSP to make sure the applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If theTPSP does not meet those applicable PCI DSSrequirements, then those requirements are also not in place for the entity.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important that the entity understands whichPCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements its TPSPs have agreed to meet, which requirements are shared between the TPSP and the entity, and for those that are shared, specifics about how the requirements are shared and which entity isresponsible for meeting each sub-requirement.Without this shared understanding, it is inevitablethat the entity and the TPSP will assume a given PCI DSS sub -requirement is the responsibility ofthe other party, and therefore that sub-requirement may not be addressed at all.The specific information an entity maintains willdepend on the particular agreement with theirproviders, the type of service, etc. TPSPs may define their PCI DSS responsibilities to be the same for all their customers; otherwise, this responsibility should be agreed upon by both the entity and TPSP.Good PracticeEntities can document these responsibilities via amatrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicates for each requirement whether the entity or TPSP is responsible for meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility. This type o f document is oftenreferred to as a responsibility matrix .(continued on next page) 12.8.5 Information is maintained about which PCIDSS requirements are managed by each TPSP, which are managed by the entity, and any that are shared between the TPSP and the entity. 12.8.5.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined to maintain information about which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each TPSP, which are managed by the entity, and any that are shared between both the TPSPand the entity.12.8.5.b Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify the entity maintains informationabout which PCI DSS requirements are managedby each TPSP, which are managed by the entity,and any that are shared between both entities. Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords detailing the PCI DSS requirements and related system components for which each TPSP issolely or jointly responsible, are maintained andreviewed periodically.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.8.5 (continued) It is also important for e ntities to understandwhether any TPSPs have nested relationshipswith other TPSPs, meaning the primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s) for the purposes of providing a service. It is important to understand whether the primary TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overallcompliance of a service, and how the primaryTPSP is monitoring performance of the service and the PCI DSS compliance status of the secondary TPSP(s). Note that it is the responsibility of the primary TPSP to manage and monitor any secondary TPSPs.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: Third-PartySecurity Assurance for a sample responsibilitymatrix template.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.9 Third- party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers' PCI DSS compliance.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIn conjunction with Requirement 12.8.2, thisrequirement is intended to promote a consistent level of understanding between TPSPs and theircustomers about their applicable PCI DSSresponsibilities. The acknowledgment from the TPSP evidences the TPSP's com mitment tomaintaining proper security of the account data that it obtains from its customers.The TPSP's internal policies and procedures related to their customer engagement processand any templates used for written agreementsshould include provision of an applicable PCI DSS acknowledgement to its customers. The method by which the TPSP provides writtenacknowledgment should be agreed between the provider and its customers. 12.9.1 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: TPSPs provide written agreement sto customers that include acknowledgment s thatTPSPs are responsible for the security of accountdata the TPSP possesses or otherwise stores,processes, or transmits on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that the TPSP could impact thesecurity of the customer's cardholder data and orsensitive authentication data . 12.9.1 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Examine TPSPpolicies, procedures, and templates used for written agreements to verify processes are defined for the TPSP to provide written acknowledgment sto customers in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveTPSPs formally acknowledge their securityresponsibilities to their customers.(continued on next page)Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceApplicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity beingassessed is a service provider.The exact wording of an agreement will depend onthe details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. Theagreement does not have to include the exactwording provided in this requirement.The TPSP's written acknowledgment is aconfirmation that states the TPSP is responsible forthe security of the account data it may store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer or to the extent the TPSP may impact the security of a customer's cardholder data and or sensitiveauthentication data.Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS requirements is not the same as a written agreement specified in this requirement. For example, a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC ), a declaration on a company's website, apolicy statement, a responsibility matrix, or otherevidence not included in a written agreement is nota written acknowledgment .Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf a TPSP does not provide the necessaryinformation to enable its customers to meet their security and compliance requirements, the customers will not be able to protect cardholder data nor meet their own contractual obligations.Good PracticeIf a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance ( AOC ), the expectation is that theTPSP should provide that to customers upon request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance status.If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS assessment, they may be able to provide othersufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has metthe applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity'sassessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers' assessors,with each assessment targeted to confirm thatapplicable requirements are met.TPSPs should provide sufficient evidence to their customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer and that the relevant PCI DSS requirements were examined anddetermined to be in place.(continued on next page) 12.9.2 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: TPSPs support their customers'requests for information to meet Requirements12.8.4 and 12.8.5 by providing the following upon customer request: PCI DSS compliance status information (Requirement 12.8.4). Information about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are the responsibility of the customer, including any shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5) , forany service the TPSP provides that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on behalf of customers orthat can impact security of customers' cardholder data or sensitive authentication data. 12.9.2 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Examine policiesand procedures to verify processes are defined for the TPSPs to support customers' request for information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and12.8.5 in accordance with all elements specified inthis requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveTPSPs provide information as needed to support their customers ' PCI DSS compliance efforts.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.9.2 (continued) TPSPs may define their PCI DSS responsibilitiesto be the same for all their customers; otherwise, this responsibility should be agreed upon by both the customer and TPSP. It is important that the customer understands which PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements its TPSPs have agreed to meet, which requirements areshared between the TPSP and the customer, andfor those that are shared, specifics about how the requirements are shared and which entity is responsible for meeting each sub-requirement. An example of a way to document these responsibilities is via a matrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicateswhether the customer or TPSP is responsible formeeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility.Further InformationFor further guidance, refer to : PCI DSS section: Use of Third-Party Service Providers . Information Supplement: Third -Party SecurityAssurance (includes a sample responsibilitymatrix template) .Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout a comprehensive incident response planthat is properly disseminated, read, and understood by the parties responsible, confusionand lack of a unified response could create furtherdowntime for the business, unnecessary public media exposure, as well as risk of financial and or reputational loss and legal liabilities.Good PracticeThe incident response plan should be thorough and contain all the key elements for stakeholders(for example, legal, communications) to allow theentity to respond effectively in the event of a breach that could impact account data . It isimportant to keep the plan up to date with current contact information of all individuals designated as having a role in incident response. Other relevant parties for notifications may include customers, financial institutions ( acquirers andissuers), and business partners .Entities should consider how to address all compromises of data within the CDE in their incident response plans, including compromises to account data, wireless encryption keys, encryption keys used for transmission and storage or account data or cardholder data, etc.(continued on next page)12.10.1 An incident response plan exists and isready to be activated in the event of a suspected orconfirmed security incident. The plan includes, but isnot limited to: Roles, responsibilities, and communication and contact strategies in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident, including notification of payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum. Incident response procedures with specificcontainment and mitigation activities for differenttypes of incidents. Business recovery and continuity procedures. Data backup processes. Analysis of legal requirements for reportingcompromises. Coverage and responses of all critical system components. Reference or inclusion of incident response procedures from the payment brands. 12.10.1.a Examine the incident response plan toverify that the plan exists and includes at least theelements specified in this requirement.12.10.1.b Interview personnel and examinedocumentation from previously reported incidentsor alerts to verify that the documented incident response plan and procedures were followed.Customized Approach ObjectiveA comprehensive incident response plan that meetscard brand expectations is maintained.Requirements and Testing Procedures Guidance12.10.1 (continued) ExamplesLegal requirements for reporting compromisesinclude those in most US states, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Personal Data Protection Act (Singapore).Further InformationFor more information, refer to the NIST SP 800 -61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeProper testing of the security incident response plan can identify broken business processes and ensure key steps are not missed, which could result in increased exposure during an incident. Periodic testing of the plan ensures that the processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that all relevant personnel in the organization are familiar with the plan.Good PracticeThe test of the incident response plan can include simulated incidents and the corresponding responses in the form of a table-top exercise that include s participation by relevant personnel.A review of the incident and the quality of the response can provide entities with the assurancethat all required elements are included in the plan. 12.10.2 At least once every 12 months, the securityincident response plan is: Reviewed and the content is updated asneeded. Tested, including all elements listed in Requirement 12.10.1. 12.10.2 Interview personnel and reviewdocumentation to verify that, at least once every 12 months, the security incident response plan is: Reviewed and updated as needed. Tested, including all elements listed in Requirement 12.10.1.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe incident response plan is kept current and tested periodically.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn incident could occur at any time, therefore if aperson who is trained in incident response andfamiliar with the entity's plan is available when an incident is detected, the entity's ability to correctly respond to the incident is increased.Good PracticeOften, specific personnel are designated to be part of a security incident response team, with the team having overall responsibility for responding to incidents (perhaps on a rotating schedule basis) and managing those incidents in accordance with the plan. The incident response team can consist of core members who arepermanently assigned or on- demand personnelwho may be called up as necessary, dependingon their expertise and the specifics of the incident.Having available resources to respond quickly to incidents minimizes disruption to the organization.Examples of types of activity the team or individuals should respond to include any evidence of unauthorized activity, detection ofunauthorized wireless access points, critical IDSalerts, and reports of unauthorized critical system or content file changes. 12.10.3 Specific personnel are designated to beavailable on a 24 7 basis to respond to suspected or confirmed security incidents. 12.10.3 Examine documentation and interviewresponsible personnel occupying designated roles to verify that specific personnel are designated to be available on a 24 7 basis to respond to security incidents.Customized Approach ObjectiveIncidents are responded to immediately where appropriate.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout a trained and readily available incidentresponse team, extended damage to the network could occur, and critical data and systems may become polluted by inappropriate handling of the targeted systems. This can hinder the success of a post -inciden t investigation.Good PracticeIt is important that all personnel involved in incident response are trained and knowledgeable about managing evidence for forensics and investigations. 12.10.4 Personnel responsible for responding tosuspected and confirmed security incidents are appropriately and periodically trained on their incident response responsibilities. 12.10.4 Examine training documentation andinterview incident response personnel to verify that personnel are appropriately and periodically trained on their incident response responsibilities.Customized Approach ObjectivePersonnel are knowledgeable about their role and responsibilities in incident response and are able to access assistance and guidance when required.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeEach entity's environment and incident response plan are different , and the approach will dependon a number of factors, including the size and complexity of the entity, the degree of change in the environment, the size of the incident responseteam, and the turnover in personnel.Performing a risk analysis will allow the entity todetermine the optimum frequency for training personnel with incident response responsibilities. 12.10.4.1 The frequency of periodic training forincident response personnel is defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement12.3.1. 12.10.4.1.a Examine the entity's targeted riskanalysis for the frequency of training for incidentresponse personnel to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elementsspecified in Requirement 12.3.1.12.10.4.1.b Examine documented results ofperiodic training of incident response personneland interview personnel to verify training isperformed at the frequency defined in the entity'stargeted risk analysis performed for this requirement. Customized Approach ObjectiveIncident response personnel are trained at a frequency that addresses the entity's risk.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeResponding to alerts generated by securitymonitoring systems that are explicitly designed to focus on potential risk to data is critical to prevent a breach and therefore, this must be included in the incident -response processes. 12.10.5 The security incident response planincludes monitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems, including but not limited to: Intrusion- detection and intrusion-preventionsystems. Network security controls. Change- detection mechanisms for critical files. The change-and tamper -detection mechanismfor payment pages. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. Detection of unauthorized wireless accesspoints. 12.10.5 Examine documentation and observeincident response processes to verify thatmonitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems are covered in the security incident response plan, including but not limited tothe systems specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveAlerts generated by monitoring and detection technologies are responded to in a structured,repeatable manner.Applicability NotesThe bullet above (for monitoring and responding to alerts from a change- and tamper -detectionmechanism for payment pages) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 12.10.5 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIncorporating lessons learned into the incidentresponse plan after an incident occurs and in- stepwith industry developments, helps keep the plan current and able to react to emerging threats and security trends.Good PracticeThe lessons -learned exercise should include alllevels of personnel. Although it is often included as part of the review of the entire incident, it should focus on how the entity's response to the incident could be improved.It is important to not just consider elements of the response that did not have the planned outcomesbut also to understand what worked well andwhether lessons from those elements that worked well can be applied to areas of the plan that didnot.Another way to optimize an entity's incident response plan is to understand the attacks made against other organizations and use that information to fine-tune the entity's detection,containment, mitigation, or recovery procedures. 12.10.6 The security incident response plan ismodified and evolved according to lessons learnedand to incorporate industry developments. 12.10.6.a Examine policies and procedures toverify that processes are defined to modify and evolve the security incident response plan according to lessons learned and to incorporate industry developments.12.10.6.b Examine the security incident responseplan and interview responsible personnel to verify that the incident response plan is modified and evolved according to lessons learned and toincorporate industry developments. Customized Approach ObjectiveThe effectiveness and accuracy of the incidentresponse plan is reviewed and updated after each invocation.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHaving documented incident responseprocedures that are followed in the event that stored PAN is found anywhere it is not expected to be, helps to identify the necessary remediation actions and prevent future leaks.Good PracticeIf PAN was found outside the CDE, analysis should be performed to 1) determine whether it was saved independently of other data or with sensitive authentication data, 2) identify the source of the data, and 3) identify the control gaps that resulted in the data being outside theCDE.Entities should consider whether there are contributory factors, such as business processes, user behavior, improper system configurations, etc. that caused the PAN to be stored in an unexpected location. If such contributory factors are present, they should be addressed per this Requirement to prevent recurrence. 12.10.7 Incident response procedures are in place,to be initiated upon the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected, and include: Determining what to do if PAN is discovered outside the CDE, including its retrieval, securedeletion, and or migration into the currentlydefined CDE, as applicable. Identifying whether sensitive authentication data is stored with PAN. Determining where the account data came fromand how it ended up where it was not expected. Remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the account data being where it wasnot expected. 12.10.7.a Examine documented incident responseprocedures to verify that procedures for respondingto the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected to exist, ready to be initiated, and include all elements specified in this requirement.12.10.7.b Interview personnel and examinerecords of response actions to verify that incident response procedures are performed upon detection of stored PAN anywhere it is notexpected.Customized Approach ObjectiveProcesses are in place to quickly respond, analyze, and address situations in the event that cleartextPAN is detected where it is not expected.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March2025, after which it will be required and must befully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.This appendix contains additional PCI DSS requirements for different types of entities. The sections within this Appendix include: Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi -Tenant Service Providers Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities U sing SSL early TLS for Card- Present POS POI Terminal Connections Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)Guidance and applicability information is provided in each section.SectionsA1.1 Multi -tenant service providers protect and separate all customer environments and data.A1.2 Multi -tenant service providers facilitate logging and incident response for all customers.OverviewAll service providers are responsible for meeting PCI DSS requirements for their own environments as applicable to the services offered to their customers. Inaddition, multi -tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix.Multi -tenant service providers are a type of third- party service provider that offer s various shared services to merchants and other service providers, wherecustomers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and or databases .Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e- commerce and or shopping cart services, web-based hosting services, payment applications , various cloud applications and services, and payment gateway and processor services offered in a sharedenvironment .Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co- location or co-lo providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth areavailable on a rental basis, are not considered multi -tenant service providers for purposes of this A ppendix.Note : Even though a multi -tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirementsthat are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared betweenthe provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to therelationships between all third- party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific servicesthe customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, andwhich requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.A1.1 Multi -tenant service providers protect and separate all customer environments and data.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout controls between the provider's environmentand the customer's environment, a malicious actorwithin the provider's environment could compromise the customer's environment, and similarly, a malicious actor in a customer environment could compromise the provider and potentially other of t heprovider's customers.Multi -tenant environments should be isolated fromeach other and from the provider's infrastructure such that they can be separately managed entities with no connectivity between them.Good PracticeProviders should ensure strong separation between the environments that are designed for customeraccess, for example, configuration and billing portals,and the provider's private environment that should only be accessed by authorized provider personnel.Service provider access to customer environments is performed in accordance with requirement 8.2.3.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: PCI SSC CloudComputing Guidelines for further guidance on cloudenvironments. A1.1.1 Logical separation is implemented asfollows: The provider cannot access its customers' environments without authorization . Customers cannot access the provider's environment without authorization. A1.1.1 Examine documentation and system andnetwork configurations and interview personnel to verify that logical separation is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveCustomers cannot access the provider's environment. The provider cannot access itscustomers' environments without authorization.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important that a multi -tenant service providerdefine controls so that each customer can onlyaccess their own environment and CDE to prevent unauthorized access from one customer'senvironment to another.ExamplesIn a cloud-based infrastructure, such as aninfrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering, the customers' CDE may include virtual network devices and virtual servers that are configured and managed by the customers, including operating systems, files,memory , etc. A1.1.2 Controls are implemented such that eachcustomer only has permission to access its owncardholder data and CDE. A1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify controlsare defined such that each customer only has permission to access its own cardholder data andCDE.A1.1.2.b Examine system configurations to verifythat customers have privileges established to onlyaccess their own account data and CDE. Customized Approach ObjectiveCustomers cannot access other customers' environments.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeTo prevent any inadvertent or intentional impact to other customers' environments or account data, it isimportant that each customer can access only resources allocated to that customer. A1.1.3 Controls are implemented such that eachcustomer can only access resources allocated tothem. A1.1.3 Examine customer privileges to verify eachcustomer can only access resources allocated to them.Customized Approach ObjectiveCustomer s cannot impact resources allocated toother customers.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeMulti -tenant services providers are responsible formanaging the segmentation between theircustomers.Without technical assurance that segmentationcontrols are effective, it is possible that changes tothe service provider's technology would inadvertently create a vulnerability that could be exploited across all the service provider's customers.Good PracticeEffectiveness of separation techniques can be confirmed by using service -provider -createdtemporary (mock -up) environments that representcustomer environments and attempting to 1) access one temporary environment from another environment, and 2) access a temporary environment from the Internet. A1.1.4 The effectiveness of logical separationcontrols used to separate customer environments is confirmed at least once everysix months via penetration testing. A1.1.4 Examine the results from the most recentpenetration test to verify that testing confirmed theeffectiveness of logical separation controls used toseparate customer environments.Customized Approach ObjectiveSegmentation of customer environments fromother environments is periodically validated to be effective.Applicability NotesThe testing of adequate separation betweencustomers in a multi-tenant service provider environment is in addition to the penetration tests specified in Requirement 11.4.6.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required andmust be fully considered during a PCI DSSassessment .A1.2 Multi -tenant service providers facilitate logging and incident response for all customers.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeLog information is useful for detecting andtroubleshooting security incidents and is invaluablefor forensic investigations. Customers therefore need to have access to these logs.However, log information can also be used by an attacker for reconnaissance, and so a customer's log information must only be accessible by the customerthat the log relates to. A1.2.1 Audit log capability is enabled for eachcustomer's environment that is consistent withPCI DSS Requirement 10, including: Logs are enabled for common third-party applications . Logs are active by default. Logs are available for review only by the owning customer. Log locations are clearly communicated to the owning customer. Log data and availability is consistent with PCI DSS Requirement 10. A1.2.1 Examine documentation and systemconfiguration settings to verify the provider has enabled audit log capability for each customer environment in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveLog capability is available to all customers without affecting the confidentiality of other customers.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIn the event of a suspected or confirmed breach ofconfidentiality of cardholder data, a customer's forensic investigator aims to find the cause of the breach, exclude the attacker from the environment,and ensure all unauthorized access is removed.Prompt and efficient responses to forensicinvestigators' requests can significantly reduce the time taken for the investigator to secure the customer's environment. A1.2.2 Processes or mechanisms areimplemented to support and or facilitate prompt forensic investigations in the event of asuspected or confirmed security incident for anycustomer. A1.2.2 Examine documented procedures to verifythat the provider has processes or mechanisms to support and or facilitate a prompt forensicinvestigation of related servers in the event of asuspected or confirmed security incident for any customer.Customized Approach ObjectiveForensic investigation is readily available to all customers in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeSecurity vulnerabilities in the provided services canimpact the security of all the service provider's customers and therefore must be managed in accordance with the service provider's establishedprocesses, with priority given to resolvingvulnerabilities that have the highest probabil ity ofcompromise.Customers are likely to notice vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations while using the service.Implementing secure methods for customers to report security incidents and vulnerabilitiesencourages customers to report potential issues andenable the provider to quickly learn about and address potential issues within their environment. A1.2.3 Processes or mechanisms areimplemented for reporting and addressing suspected or confirmed security incidents andvulnerabilities, including: Customers can securely report securityincidents and vulnerabilities to the provider. The provider addresses and remediates suspected or confirmed security incidents and vulnerabilities according to Requirement 6.3.1. A1.2.3 Examine documented procedures andinterview personnel to verify that the provider has a mechanism for reporting and addressingsuspected or confirmed security incidents andvulnerabilities, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveSuspected or confirmed security incidents or vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed.Customers are informed where appropriate.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Terminal ConnectionsSectionsA2.1 POI terminals using SSL and or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL TLS exploits.OverviewThis Appendix applies only to entities using SSL early TLS as a security control to protect POS POI terminals, including service providers thatprovide connections into POS POI terminals.Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon aspossible. Additionally, SSL and or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don't already exist. At the time ofpublication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits.The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are: Requirement 2.2.5: Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons. Requirement 2.2.7: All non -console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography. Requirement 4.2.1: Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks.SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are included: New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control. All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering. Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place. POS POI terminals in card- present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS,and the SSL TLS termination points to which they connect, may continue using SSL early TLS as a security control.Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.Requirements and Testing Procedures GuidanceA2.1 POI terminals using SSL and or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL TLS exploits.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePOS POI terminals used in card-presentenvironments can continue using SSL early TLSwhen it can be shown that the POS POI terminalis not susceptible to the currently known exploits.Good PracticeHowever, SSL is outdated technology and could be susceptible to additional security vulnerabilities in the future; it is therefore strongly recommended that POS POI terminals be upgraded to a secure protocol as soon as possible. If SSL early TLS isnot needed in the environment, use of, andfallback to these versions should be disabled.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL Early TLS for further guidance. A2.1.1 Where POS POI terminals at the merchantor payment acceptance location use SSL and or early TLS, the entity confirms the devices are notsusceptible to any known exploits for thoseprotocols. A2.1.1 For POS POI terminals using SSL and orearly TLS, confirm the entity has documentation (for example, vendor documentation, system networkconfiguration details) that verifies the devices are notsusceptible to any known exploits for SSL early TLS.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.Applicability NotesThis requirement is intended to apply to the entitywith the POS POI terminal, such as a merchant. This requirement is not intended for serviceproviders who serve as the termination orconnection point to those POS POI terminals. Requirements A2.1.2 and A2.1.3 apply to POS POI service providers.The allowance for POS POI terminals that are not currently susceptible to exploits is based on currently known risks. If new exploits are introduced to which POS POI terminals aresusceptible, the POS POI terminals will need to beupdated immediately.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePOS POI termination points, including but notlimited to service providers such as acquirers oracquirer processors, can continue using SSL earlyTLS when it can be shown that the service provider has controls in place that mitigate the risk of supporting those connections for the service provider environment.Good PracticeService providers should communicate to all customers using SSL early TLS about the risks associated with its use and the need to migrate to a secure protocol.DefinitionsThe Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan is adocument prepared by the entity that details its plans for migrating to a secure protocol anddescribes controls the entity has in place toreduce the risk associated with SSL early TLS until the migration is com plete.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL early TLS for further guidance on Risk Mitigation and Migration Plans. A2.1.2 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only: All service providers with existingconnection points to POS POI terminals that use SSL and or early TLS as defined in A2.1 have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place that includes: Description of usage, including what data is being transmitted, types and number of systems that use and or support SSL earlyTLS, and type of environment. Risk-assessment results and risk -reductioncontrols in place. Description of processes to monitor for newvulnerabilities associated with SSL early TLS. Description of change control processes that are implemented to ensure SSL early TLS isnot implemented into new environments. Overview of migration project plan to replaceSSL early TLS at a future date. A2.1.2 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Review thedocumented Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan to verify it includes all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entitybeing assessed is a service provider.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeCustomers must be able to choose to upgradetheir POIs to eliminate the vulnerability in usingSSL and early TLS. In many cases, customers will need to take a phased or gradual approach to migrate their POS POI estate from the insecure protocol to a secure protocol and so will require the service provider to support a secure offering.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL Early TLS for further guidance. A2.1.3 Additional requirement for serviceproviders only : All service providers provide asecure service offering. A2.1.3 Additional testing procedure for serviceprovider assessments only: Examine systemconfigurations and supporting documentation to verify the service provider offers a secure protocol option for its service.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.SectionsA3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.A3.3 PCI DSS is incorporated into business -as-usual ( BAU) activities.A3.4 Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.A3.5 Suspicious events are identified and responded to.OverviewThis Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSSrequirements. An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or apayment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include: Those storing, processing, and or transmitting large volumes of account data , Those providing aggregation points for account data, or Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data.Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on acontinuous basis through validation of business -as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping considerat ion.(continued on next page)Note : Some PCI DSS requirements in this Appendix have defined timeframes (for example, an activity that is to be performed at least onceevery three months or six months). For an initial assessment to such requirements, it is not required that an activity has been performed forevery such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies: The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recentthree- month or six -month period), and The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe.For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe. F or example, anactivity required at least every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does notexceed 90-92 days.Refer to section 7 Descriptions of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements for additional guidance about initial assessments.Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSSRequirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.A3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeExecutive management assignment of PCI DSScompliance responsibilities ensures executive -level visibility into the PCI DSS compliance program and allows for the opportunity to ask appropriate questions to determine theeffectiveness of the program and influencestrategic priorities.Good PracticeExecutive management may include C -levelpositions, board of directors, or equivalent. The specific titles will depend on the particular organizational structure.Responsibility for the PCI DSS complianceprogram may be assigned to individual rolesand or to business units within the organization. A3.1.1 Responsibility is established by executivemanagement for the protection of account data anda PCI DSS compliance program that includes: Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSS compliance. Defining a charter for a PCI DSS complianceprogram. Providing updates to executive managementand board of directors on PCI DSS compliance initiatives and issues, including remediation activities, at least once every 12 months.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 12 A3.1.1.a Examine documentation to verifyexecutive management has assigned overall accountability for maintaining the entity's PCI DSS compliance.A3.1.1.b Examine the company's PCI DSS charterto verify it outlines the conditions under which the PCI DSS compliance program is organized.A3.1.1.c Examine executive management andboard of directors meeting minutes and or presentations to ensure PCI DSS compliance initiatives and remediation activities are communicated at least once every 12 months.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproachDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA formal compliance program allows anorganization to monitor the health of its securitycontrols, be proactive if a control fails, andeffectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization.Good PracticeThe PCI DSS compliance program can be a dedicated program or part of overarchingcompliance and or governance program, andshould include a well -defined methodology thatdemonstrates consistent and effective evaluation.Strategic business decisions that should be analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may include mergers and acquisitions, new technology purchases, or new payment -acceptancechannels.DefinitionsMaintaining and monitoring an organization's overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly, every three months, or annually, and ensuring these activities are being performed accordingly (for example, using a security self -assessment orPDCA methodology).ExamplesMethodologies that support the management of compliance programs include Plan-Do -Check -Act(PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six Sigma. A3.1.2 A formal PCI DSS compliance program is inplace that includes: Definition of activities for maintaining and monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance, including business -as-usual activities. Annual PCI DSS assessment processes. Processes for the continuous validation of PCI DSS requirements (for example, daily, weekly, every three months, as applicable per therequirement). A process for performing business -impactanalysis to determine potential PCI DSS impactsfor strategic business decisions.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 1- 12 A3.1.2.a Examine information security policies andprocedures to verify that processes are defined for a formal PCI DSS compliance program that includes all elements specified in this requirement.A3.1.2.b Interview personnel and observecompliance activities to verify that a formal PCI DSS compliance program is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe formal definition of specific PCI DSScompliance roles and responsibilities helps toensure accountability and monitoring of ongoing PCI DSS compliance efforts.Good PracticeOwnership should be assigned to individuals with the authority to make risk -based decisions , andupon whom accountability rests for the specificfunction. Duties should be formally defined, andowners should be able to demonstrate an understanding of their responsibilities and accountability.Compliance roles may be assigned to a single owner or multiple owners for different requirement elements. A3.1.3 PCI DSS compliance roles andresponsibilities are specifically defined and formally assigned to one or more personnel, including: Managing PCI DSS business -as-usual activities. Managing annual PCI DSS assessments. Managing continuous validation of PCI DSS requirements (for example, daily, weekly, every three months, as applicable per the requirement). Managing business -impact analysis todetermine potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business decisions.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 12 A3.1.3.a Examine information security policies andprocedures and interview personnel to verify that PCI DSS compliance roles and responsibilities are specifically defined and formally assigned to one or more personnel in accordance with all elements of this requi rement.A3.1.3.b Interview responsible personnel andverify they are familiar with and performing their designated PCI DSS compliance responsibilities.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePersonnel responsible for PCI DSS compliancehave specific training needs exceeding that whichis typically provided by general security awareness training to enable them to perform their role.Good PracticeIndividuals with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities should receive specialized trainingthat, in addition to a general awareness ofinformation security, focuses on specific securitytopics, skills, processes, or methodologies that must be followed for those individuals to perform their compliance responsibilities effectively.Training may be offered by third parties such as the PCI SSC (for example, PCI Awareness, PCIP, and ISA), payment brands, and acquirers , ortraining may be internal. Training content should be applicable for the individual's job function, be current, and include the latest security threats and or version of PCI DSS.Further InformationFor additional guidance, r efer to InformationSupplement: Best Practices for Implementing aSecurity Awareness Program . A3.1.4 Up-to-date PCI DSS and or informationsecurity training is provided at least once every 12months to personnel with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities (as identified in A3.1.3).PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 12 A3.1.4.a Examine information security policies andprocedures to verify that PCI DSS and or information security training is required at least once every 12 months for each role with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities.A3.1.4.b Interview personnel and examinecertificates of attendance or other records to verify that personnel with PCI DSS compliance responsibility receive up-to -date PCI DSS and orsimilar information security training at least once every 12 months. Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeFrequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps toensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.Good PracticeAccurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in -scope sy stems are appropriately secured.When documenting account data locations, theentity can consider creating a table orspreadsheet that includes the following information: Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including purpose of data storage and the retention period, Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expirydate, cardholder name, and or any elementsof SAD prior to completion of authorization), How data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization), How access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level,operating system level, etc.).(continued on next page) A3.2.1 PCI DSS scope is documented andconfirmed for accuracy at least once every threemonths and upon significant changes to the in-scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes: Identifying all data flows for the various paymentstages (for example, authorization, capture,settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and acceptance channels (for example, card-present, card- not-present, and e-commerce). Updating all data-flow diagrams per Requirement 1.2.4. Identifying all locations where account data isstored, processed, and transmitted, including butnot limited to 1) any locations outside of thecurrently defined CDE, 2) applications thatprocess CHD, 3) transmissions between systems and networks, and 4) file backups. For any account data found outside of the currently defined CDE, either 1) securely delete it, 2) migrate it into the currently defined CDE, or3) expand the currently defined CDE to includeit. Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impact security of the CDE.(continued on next page) A3.2.1.a Examine documented results of scopereviews and interview personnel to verify that the reviews are performed: At least once every three months. After significant changes to the in- scopeenvironment.A3.2.1.b Examine documented results of scopereviews occurring at least once every three months to verify that scoping validation includes all elements specified in this requirement. Identifying all segmentation controls in use andthe environment(s) from which the CDE issegmented, including justification forenvironments being out of scope Identifying all connections to third-party entities with access to the CDE. Confirming that all identified data flows, account data, system components, segmentation controls, and connections from third parties withaccess to the CDE are included in scope.PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements, Requirement 12.In addition to internal systems and networks, allconnections from third -party entities -forexample, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers -need to be identified to determineinclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in- scopeconnections have been identified, the applicable PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce the risk of a third-party connection being used tocompromise an entity's CDE.A data discovery tool or methodology can be usedto facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE -for example, in an error log or memory dump file. This approach can help ensure that previouslyunknown locations of PAN are detected and thatthe PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: Guidance forPCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation foradditional guidance.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeChanges to systems or networks can have asignificant impact on PCI DSS scope. Forexample, changes to network security controlrulesets can bring whole network segments into scope, or new systems may be added to the CDE that have to be appropriately protected.A formal impact assessment performed in advance of a change gives the entity assurancethat the change will not adversely affect thesecurity of the CDE.Good PracticeProcesses to determine the potential impact that changes to systems and networks may have on an entity's PCI DSS scope may be performed as part of a dedicated PCI DSS compliance program or may fall under an entity's overarchingcompliance and or governance program. A3.2.2 PCI DSS scope impact for all changes tosystems or networks is determined, includingadditions of new systems and new network connections. Processes include: Performing a formal PCI DSS impact assessment. Identifying applicable PCI DSS requirements to the system or network. Updating PCI DSS scope as appropriate. Documented sign- off of the results of the impactassessment by responsible personnel (as defined in A3.1.3).PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements; Requirements 1-12 A3.2.2 Examine change documentation andinterview personnel to verify that for each change to systems or networks the PCI DSS scope impact is determined, and includes all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIt is important to have processes to analyze allchanges made to systems or networks, to ensurethat all appropriate PCI DSS controls are applied to any systems or networks added to the in- scopeenvironment due to a change.Building this validation into change managementprocesses helps ensure that device inventories and configuration standards are kept up to date,and security controls are applied where needed.Good PracticeA change management process should includesupporting evidence that PCI DSS requirements are implemented or preserved through an iterative process.ExamplesPCI DSS requirements that should be verifiedinclude, but are not limited to: Network diagrams are updated to reflectchanges. Systems are configured per configurationstandards, with all default passwords changed and unnecessary services disabled. Systems are protected with requiredcontrols -for example, file integrity monitoring,antimalware, patches, and audit logging. Sensitive authentication data is not stored,and all account data storage is documented and incorporated into data- retention policy andprocedures. New systems are included in the quarterly vulnerability scanning process. A3.2.2.1 Upon completion of a change, all relevantPCI DSS requirements are confirmed to be implemented on all new or changed systems and networks, and documentation is updated as applicable.PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements; Requirement 1 -12 A3.2.2.1 Examine change records and the affectedsystems networks, and interview personnel to verify that all relevant PCI DSS requirements were confirmed to be implemented and documentation updated as part of the change.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAn organization's structure and managementdefine the requirements and protocol for effectiveand secure operations. Changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported PCI DSS controls or inheriting new responsibilities that may not have established controls in place. Therefore, it isimportant to revisit PCI DSS scope and controlswhen there are changes to an organization's structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active.ExamplesChanges to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes orreassignments of personnel with responsibility forsecurity control. A3.2.3 Changes to organizational structure result ina formal (internal) review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 12 A3.2.3 Examine policies and procedures to verifythat a change to organizational structure results in formal a review of the impact on PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePCI DSS normally requires segmentation controlsto be verified by penetration testing every twelvemonths.Validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover failings in segmentation before they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot laterally from an out -of-scope untrustednetwork to the CDE.Good PracticeAlthough the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after a significant change, this exercise should be performed as frequently as possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE from other networks.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: PenetrationTesting Guidance for additional guidance. A3.2.4 If segmentation is used, PCI DSS scope isconfirmed as follows: Per the entity's methodology defined at Requirement 11.4.1. Penetration testing is performed on segmentation controls at least once every six months and after any changes to segmentation controls methods. The penetration testing covers all segmentationcontrols methods in use. The penetration testing verifies thatsegmentation controls methods are operational and effective, and isolate the CDE from all out -of-scope systems.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 11 A3.2.4 Examine the results from the most recentpenetration test to verify that the test was conducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposePCI DSS requires that, as part of the scopingexercise, assessed entities must identify anddocument the existence of all cleartext PAN in their environments. Implementing a data-discovery methodology that identifies all sources and locations of cleartext PAN and looks for cleartext PAN on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpectedplaces within the defined CDE -for example, inan error log or memory dump file- helps toensure that previously unknown locations ofcleartext PAN are detected and properly secured.ExamplesA data-discovery process can be performed via a variety of methods, including, but not limited to 1) commercially available data-discovery software,2) an in-house developed data -discoveryprogram, or 3) a manual search. A combination ofmethodologies may also be used as needed.Regardless of the method used, the goal of the effort is to find all sources and locations of cleartext PAN (not just in the defined CDE). A3.2.5 A data- discovery methodology isimplemented that: Confirms PCI DSS scope. Locates all sources and locations of cleartext PAN at least once every three months and upon significant changes to the CDE or processes. Addresses the potential for cleartext PAN to reside on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE.PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements A3.2.5.a Examine the documented data- discoverymethodology to verify it includes all elements specified in this requirement.A3.2.5.b Examine results from recent datadiscovery efforts, and interview responsiblepersonnel to verify that data discovery is performedat least once every three months and upon significant changes to the CDE or processes.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approachDefined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeA process to test the effectiveness of the methodsused for data discovery ensures thecompleteness and accuracy of account datadetection.Good PracticeFor completeness, system components in the in-scope networks, and systems in out -of-scopenetworks, should be included in the data-discovery process.The data-discovery process should be effectiveon all operating systems and platforms in use. Accuracy can be tested by placing test PANs on system components and file formats in use and confirming that the data-discovery method detected the test PANs. A3.2.5.1 Data discovery methods are confirmed asfollows: Effectiveness of methods is tested. Methods are able to discover cleartext PAN onall types of system components and file formats in use. The effectiveness of data-discovery methods is confirmed at least once every 12 months.PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements A3.2.5.1.a Interview personnel and reviewdocumentation to verify: The entity has a process in place to test the effectiveness of methods used for data discovery. The process includes verifying the methods are able to discover cleartext PAN on all types of system components and file formats in use.A3.2.5.1.b Examine the results of effectivenesstests to verify that the effectiveness of data-discovery methods is confirmed at least once every 12 months.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHaving documented response procedures that arefollowed in the event cleartext PAN is foundoutside the CDE helps to identify the necessary remediation actions and prevent future leaks.Good PracticeIf PAN was found outside the CDE, an analysis should be performed to 1) determine whether it was saved independently of other data or withsensitive authentication data, 2) to identify thesource of the data, and 3) identify the control gaps that resulted in the data being outside the CDE.Entities should consider whether contributory factors, such as business processes, user behavior, improper system configurations, etc., caused the PAN to be stored in an unexpected location. If such contributory factors are present,they should be addressed per this Requirement toprevent a recurrence. A3.2.5.2 Response procedures are implemented tobe initiated upon the detection of cleartext PAN outside the CDE to include: Determining what to do if cleartext PAN is discovered outside the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion, and or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable. Determining how the data ended up outside the CDE. Remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the data being outside the CDE. Identifying the source of the data. Identifying whether any track data is stored with the PANs. A3.2.5.2.a Examine documented responseprocedures to verify that procedures for responding to the detection of cleartext PAN outside the CDE are defined and include all elements specified in this requirement.A3.2.5.2.b Interview personnel and examinerecords of response actions to verify that remediation activities are performed when cleartext PAN is detected outside the CDE.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe use of mechanisms to detect and preventunauthorized PAN from leaving the CDE allowsan organization to detect and prevent situations that may lead to data loss.Good PracticeCoverage of the mechanisms should include, but not be limited to, e- mails, downloads to removablemedia, and output to printers.ExamplesMechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized loss of cleartext PAN may include the use of appropriate tools such as data loss prevention (DLP) solutions as well as manual processes and procedures. A3.2.6 Mechanisms are implemented for detectingand preventing cleartext PAN from leaving the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process, including mechanisms that are: Actively running. Configured to detect and prevent cleartext PAN leaving the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process. Generating audit logs and alerts upon detectionof cleartext PAN leaving the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process.PCI DSS Reference : Scope of PCI DSSRequirements, Requirement 12 A3.2.6.a Examine documentation and observeimplemented mechanisms to verify that the mechanisms are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.A3.2.6.b Examine audit logs and alerts, andinterview responsible personnel to verify that alerts are investigated.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeAttempts to remove cleartext PAN via anunauthorized channel, method, or process mayindicate malicious intent to steal data, or may be the actions of an authorized employee who is unaware of or simply not following the proper methods. Prompt investigation of theseoccurrences can identify where remediation needs to be applied and provides valuableinformation to help understand from where thethreats are coming. A3.2.6.1 Response procedures are implemented tobe initiated upon the detection of attempts to remove cleartext PAN from the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process. Response procedures include: Procedures for the prompt investigation of alerts by responsible personnel. Procedures for remediating data leaks or process gaps, as necessary, to prevent any dataloss.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 12 A3.2.6.1.a Examine documented responseprocedures to verify that procedures for respondingto the attempted removal of cleartext PAN from the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process include all elements specified in this requirement : Procedures for the prompt investigation of alerts by responsible personnel. Procedures for remediating data leaks orprocess gaps, as necessary, to prevent anydata loss.A3.2.6.1.b Interview personnel and examinerecords of actions taken when cleartext PAN isdetected leaving the CDE via an unauthorizedchannel, method, or process and verify that remediation activities were performed. Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.A3.3 PCI DSS is incorporated into business- as-usual ( BAU) activities.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeWithout formal processes for the prompt (as soonas possible) detection, alerting, and addressing of critical security control failures, failures may go undetected or remain unresolved for extended periods. In addition, without formalized time-bound processes, attackers will have ample timeto compromise systems and steal account datafrom the CDE.Good PracticeThe specific types of failures may vary, depending on the function of the device system component and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function ornot functioning in its intended manner, such as afirewal l erasing all its rules or going offline. A3.3.1 Failures of critical security control systemsare detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of: Network security controls IDS IPS FIM Anti-malware solutions Physical access controls Logical access controls Audit logging mechanisms Segmentation controls (if used) Automated audit log review mechanisms. Thisbullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details. Automated code review tools (if used). Thisbullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 1- 12 A3.3.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures to verify that processes are defined to promptly detect, alert, and address critical security control failures in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.A3.3.1.b Examine detection and alertingprocesses, and interview personnel to verify that processes are implemented for all critical security controls specified in this requirement and that each failure of a critical security control results in thegeneration of an alert.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.(continued on next page)Applicability NotesThe bullets above (for automated log reviewmechanisms and automated code review tools (ifused)) are best practices until 31 March 2025, after which they will be required as part of Requirement A3.3.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeIf alerts from failures of critical security control systems are not responded to quickly and effectively, attackers may use this time to insert malicious software, gain control of a system, or steal data from the entity's environment.Good PracticeDocumented evidence (for example, records within a problem management system) should support processes and procedures in place that respond to security failures. In addition, personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions and responses to the failure should be captured in the documentedevidence. A3.3.1.1 Failures of any critical security controlsystems are responded to promptly. Processes forresponding to failures in security control systems include: Restoring security functions. Identifying and documenting the duration (dateand time from start to end) of the security failure. Identifying and documenting the cause(s) offailure, including root cause, and documenting remediation required to address the root cause. Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure. Determining whether further actions are required as a result of the security failure. Implementing controls to prevent the cause of failure from reoccurring. Resuming monitoring of security controls.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 1- 12 A3.3.1.1.a Examine documented policies andprocedures and interview personnel to verify processes are defined and implemented to respond promptly to a security control failure in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.A3.3.1.1.b Examine records to verify that securitycontrol failures are documented to include: Identification of cause(s) of the failure, including root cause. Duration (date and time start and end) of the security failure. Details of the remediation required to address the root cause.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeHardware and software technologies areconstantly evolving, and organizations need to beaware of changes to the technologies they use, aswell as the evolving threats to those technologies. Conducting appropriate reviews of these technologies ensures that they can prepare for, and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware andsoftware that will not be remediated by the vendoror developer.Good PracticeOrganizations should also consider reviewingfirmware versions to ensure they remain current and supported by the vendors.Organizations also need to be aware of changes made by technology vendors to their products or processes to understand how such changes mayimpact the organization's use of the technology.Regular reviews of technologies that impact orinfluence PCI DSS controls can assist with purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies and ensure controls that rely on those technologies remain effective. These reviews include, but are not limited to, revi ewingtechnologies that are no longer supported by the vendor and or no longer meet the security needs of the organization. A3.3.2 Hardware and software technologies arereviewed at least once every 12 months to confirm whether they continue to meet the organization's PCI DSS requirements.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 2, 6, 12. A3.3.2.a Examine documented policies andprocedures and interview personnel to verify processes are defined and implemented to review hardware and software technologies to confirm whether they continue to meet the organization's PCI DSS requirements.A3.3.2.b Review the results of the recent reviewsof hardware and software technologies to verify reviews are performed at least once every 12 months.A3.3.2.c Review documentation to verify that, forany technologies that have been determined to no longer meet the organization's PCI DSS requirements, a plan is in place to remediate the technology.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesThe process includes a plan for remediating technologies that no longer meet the organization's PCI DSS requirements, up to and including replacement of the technology, as appropriate.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegularly confirming that security policies andprocedures are being followed providesassurance that the expected controls are active and working as intended. The objective of these reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS requirements, but to confirm that security activities are being performed on an ongoing basis.Good PracticeThese reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained-for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,reviews of network security control rulesets -toassist in the entity's preparation for its next PCI DSS assessment.ExamplesLooking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example,Requirement A3.3.3 is met by confirming, at leastonce every three months, that reviews of configurations of network security controls have occurred at the required frequency. On the other hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing those configurations as specified in the requirement. A3.3.3 Reviews are performed at least once everythree months to verify BAU activities are beingfollowed. Reviews are performed by personnel assigned to the PCI DSS compliance program (as identified in A3.1.3), and include: Confirmation that all BAU activities, including A3.2.2, A3.2.6, and A3.3.1, are being performed. Confirmation that personnel are following security policies and operational procedures (forexample, daily log reviews, ruleset reviews fornetwork security controls, configuration standards for new systems). Documenting how the reviews were completed, including how all BAU activities were verified as being in place. Collection of documented evidence as requiredfor the annual PCI DSS assessment. Review and sign-off of results by personnelassigned responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program, as identified in A3.1.3. Retention of records and documentation for at least 12 months, covering all BAU activities.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 1- 12 A3.3.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verifythat processes are defined for reviewing and verifying BAU activities in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.A3.3.3.b Interview responsible personnel andexamine records of reviews to verify that: Reviews are performed by personnel assigned to the PCI DSS compliance program. Reviews are performed at least once everythree months.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.A3.4 Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeRegular review of access rights helps to detectexcessive access rights remaining after user job responsibilities change, system functions change, or other modifications. If excessive user rights are not revoked in due time, they may be used bymalicious users for unauthorized access.This review provides another opportunity toensure that accounts for all terminated users have been removed (if any were missed at the time of termination), as well as to ensure that any third parties that no longer need access have had their access termin ated. A3.4.1 User accounts and access privileges to in-scope system components are reviewed at least once every six months to ensure user accounts andaccess privileges remain appropriate based on job function, and that all access is authorized.PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 7 A3.4.1 Interview responsible personnel andexamine supporting documentation to verify that : User accounts and access privileges are reviewed at least every six months. Reviews confirm that access is appropriate based on job function and that all access isauthorized.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.A3.5 Suspicious events are identified and responded to.Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures PurposeThe ability to identify attack patterns andundesirable behavior across systems -forexample, using centrally managed or automatedlog-correlation tools - is critical in preventing,detecting, or minimizing the impact of a datacompromise. The presence of logs i n allenvironments allows thorough tracking, alerting,and analysis when something goes wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without a process to corroborate information from critical system components and systems that perform security functions, such as network security controls,IDS IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM)systems. Thus, logs for all critical system components and systems that perform security functions need to be collected, correlated, and maintained. This could include using softwareproducts and service methodologies to provide real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such assecurity information and event management (SIEM), FIM, or change detection. A3.5.1 A methodology is implemented for theprompt identification of attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems that includes: Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as it occurs. Issuance of prompt alerts upon detection ofsuspicious activity or anomaly to responsiblepersonnel. Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures.PCI DSS Reference : Requirements 10, 12 A3.5.1.a Examine documentation and interviewpersonnel to verify a methodology is defined and implemented to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems in a prompt manner, and includes all elements specified in this requirement.A3.5.1.b Examine incident response proceduresand interview responsible personnel to verify that: On-call personnel receive prompt alerts. Alerts are responded to per documentedresponse procedures.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customizedapproach.Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate anddocumented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement throughimplementation of other, or compensating, controls.Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:"

When evaluating above and beyond for compensating controls, consider the following:a) Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item underreview. For example, passwords for non- console administrative access must be sentencrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting cleartext administrative passwords. An entitycannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords,etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other passwor drequirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review (passwords).b) Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they arerequired for another area but are not required for the item under review.c) Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is unable to address a vulnerability thatis exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of thefollowing: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting network access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS IPSmonitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface. Note: All compensating controlsmust be reviewed and validated forsufficiency by the assessor whoconducts the PCI DSSassessment. The effectiveness ofa compensating control isdependent on the specifics of theenvironment in which the control isimplemented, the surroundingsecurity controls, and theconfiguration of the control.Entities should be aware that agiven compensating control will notbe effective in all environments."

Maintenance Define process (es) and controls in place tomaintain compensating controls.This approach is intended for entities that decide to meet a PCI DSS requirement's stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that doesnot strictly follow the defined requirement. The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement'sCustomized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for thatorganization.The entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria: Document and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Temp late inPCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach on the PCI SSC website Perform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all informationspecified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in PCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach on the PCISSC website . Perform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tes ted,when testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix. Monitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control. Provide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its assessor.The assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria: Review the entity's controls matrix(es), target ed risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customizedcontrol(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements. Derive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control. Test each customized control to determine whether the entity's implementation 1) meets the requirement's Customized ApproachObjective and 2) results in an in place finding for the requirement. At all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA isinvolved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist withthe assessment of that customized control.The entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the customized approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the deri ved testing the assessorwill perform.Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4. x ROC Template available on the PCI SSC website.Entities that complete a Se lf-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a c ustomized a pproach; however, these entities may elect tohave a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands andacquirers ). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for example, w hetheran entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.Note: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity todetermine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement's Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to eff ectivelyimplement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls.Sample templates to support the Customized Approach ( the Sample Controls Matrix Template and Sample Targeted Risk Analysis Template)provide examples of formats that could be used by entities when documenting their Customized Approach. While it is not required that entitiesfollow the specific formats provided in these sample templates, the entity's control matrix and targeted risk analysis must i nclude all theinformation as defined in these templates.These sample templates are available on the PCI SSC website.Requirement 6PCI DSS Requirement 6 defines requirements for the development and maintenance of secure systems and software. Because the PC I SSCSecure Software Standard and the Secure SLC Standard (collectively, the Sof tware Security Framework) include rigorous software securityrequirements, the use of bespoke and custom software that is developed and maintained in accordance with either standard can help theentity to meet several requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 6 without having to perform additional detailed test ing, and may also support useof the Customized Approach for other requirements. For details, see Table 7 .Note : This support for meeting Requirement 6 applies only to software that is specifically developed and maintained in accordance with theSecure Software Standard or the Secure SLC Standard; it does not extend to other software or system components in scope f orRequirement 6.Table 7.

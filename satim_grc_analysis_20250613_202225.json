This includes thorough user access reviews (minimum quarterly), multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts, and regular security awareness training.  (Mettre en œuvre un système robuste de contrôle d'accès basé sur le principe du moindre privilège. Cela comprend des examens approfondis des accès utilisateurs (au minimum trimestriels), une authentification multifacteur (MFA) pour tous les comptes privilégiés et une formation régulière à la sensibilisation à la sécurité.)",
